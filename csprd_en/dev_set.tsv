The smart lighting system supports manual configuration of sleep aid mode. By setting the effective time of the sleep aid mode and reasonably setting the gradient range and speed of color temperature and brightness, the sleep aid mode can be manually implemented. In cases where customization is needed or when adjusting the daily routine, manual configuration is more practical than automatic configuration. If sleep problems persist, manual configuration of the sleep aid mode can be tried, and adjustments can be made based on sleep conditions after a period of time, gradually improving sleep quality. Scientifically equipped with exclusive color temperature and brightness for infants and young children, setting sleep aid mode, play mode, and night feeding mode, and saving them through the app to switch modes for scientific parenting. Sleep aid mode for infants: Set the color temperature and brightness of the ceiling light and light strip to 2700K and 10% respectively and save the settings. Play mode: Set the color temperature and brightness of the ceiling light, wall light, and light strip to 4000K and 80% respectively. Night feeding mode: Set the default brightness of the bedside lamp to 20%, color temperature to 2700K, or turn on the bedside lamp's night light mode and set the effective time period for the night light mode. With the help of a Bluetooth wireless switch or a motion sensor, moonlight mode, night waking mode, and wake-up mode can be achieved simultaneously. Moonlight mode: Before going to sleep, children can enter moonlight mode by double-clicking the Bluetooth wireless switch on the bedside, and then double-click the switch again to trigger the delayed light-off function, gradually dimming the light until it turns off. Night waking mode: Cultivate children's independent habit of getting up at night. Most smart lights have a night light mode, which has low brightness and color temperature suitable for nighttime lighting needs. For example, set it from 22:00 to 6:00. When the child wants to get up at night, they can use the bedside wireless switch to turn on the light or the motion sensor can automatically trigger the night light mode. In this way, the child will enter an environment with low color temperature and low brightness when getting up at night. After the night activities are over, the child can manually turn off the bedside switch or set the ""automatic delayed light-off"" time in advance, allowing the lights to automatically turn off, allowing the child to quickly return to sleep after a short period of activity. Wake-up mode: Cultivate children's regular daily routine. Like adults, children also need a ""wake-up mode"". The children's ceiling light also has a built-in ""sunlight algorithm"". As the sun gradually rises and the child is about to wake up, the ceiling light simulates the light changes of the rising sun to wake up the child to a beautiful day. By using this method that conforms to the human circadian rhythm, children's voluntary habit of getting up on time can be developed as soon as possible. When the elderly get up at night, they can easily turn on the smart dimming switch on the bedside or the motion sensor under the bed can sense the movement of the elderly getting out of bed, triggering the smart ceiling light. Then, the night light under the bed lights up, and the night light on the way to the bathroom lights up in advance when the motion sensor senses someone approaching. The night light in the medicine storage area is also ready at any time. When the bathroom door is opened, the door magnetic sensor triggers the bathroom heater light to turn on. When the elderly return to the bedroom, they can easily turn off the lights with the dimming switch on the bedside or when the motion sensor detects no movement after a period of time, all lights will automatically turn off. The company has collaborated with the gaming application and service platform Overwolf to release an innovative tool for gaming experiences. This tool can capture key events in games and map these events to different lighting scenes. Players can configure different lighting effects for these game scenes through the online platform to enhance the gaming experience. For example, if the player wins the game, they can map the ""victory"" event to the light strip, and the color, flicker frequency, and rhythm of the light strip can reflect this game event. By connecting smart lamps, smart curtains, and speakers to the smart home system, a dedicated home theater can be created in the living room. In addition, the ""color picking"" linkage function of smart lamps and smart TVs can be used to project the scene colors played on the TV through smart lamps, making the viewing experience more immersive."

494	Nanjing Shihao Gene Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft)	'通用' translates to 'universal' or 'general' in English.	"During the reporting period, the issuer's main businesses included clinical testing services, research and development services, and instrument reagent sales. 1. Clinical testing services: The advancement of life sciences has promoted human understanding of cancer. Tumor classification and treatment are no longer solely based on the location of the lesion, but also consider molecular genetic information. In recent years, there has been a continuous emergence of targeted therapies for anti-tumor treatment, with new immune checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-1/PD-L1 being launched on the market. The selection of tumor treatments has become more diverse, gradually transitioning from the era of traditional chemotherapy to the era of molecular targeted and immune therapies. It is of great significance to detect tumor-related gene variations to determine which specific treatment drugs patients can benefit from, and to provide personalized and precise treatment. The issuer's clinical testing services cover major solid tumors and hematological system tumors, and the revenue from these services accounts for approximately 70% of the main business income. Figure 6-1 shows the main application scenarios of the issuer's clinical testing services. The tumor precision medicine high-throughput gene testing panel includes a set of selected genes or gene regions that are associated with known or researched diseases or phenotypes. Depending on the number of genes tested, it can be divided into small panels and large panels. The company's core service project, ""Shihe No.1,"" is a panoramic multi-gene large panel testing product based on high-throughput sequencing platforms. It is widely applicable to newly diagnosed patients with solid tumors, drug-resistant patients, and recurrent patients, covering 437 mainstream cancer driver genes, systematically including gene information and rare mutation sites upstream and downstream of tumor-related pathways. It accurately reveals various gene point mutations, base insertions/deletions, copy number variations, and gene fusions, which can guide targeted drug selection, monitor treatment effects, indicate drug resistance trends, and evaluate tumor genetic risks. Immunotherapy is another important means of clinical treatment for tumors, which may bring long-term clinical benefits to cancer patients. Currently, several immunotherapy drugs have been approved for marketing. However, compared to the high response rates brought by targeted drugs combined with driver gene testing, immunotherapy still faces challenges such as longer clinical response time, lower overall response rate, and significant individual differences in efficacy. Therefore, it is urgent to develop multiple efficacy indicators to synergistically enrich potential beneficiaries of immunotherapy drugs and improve drug efficacy and benefits. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) are new independent biomarkers discovered in recent years, showing unique value in predicting drug efficacy in multiple immunotherapy clinical studies. The issuer has independently developed TMB and MSI testing and analysis methods based on large panel gene testing. These methods can effectively predict the population with immunotherapy advantages, provide molecular biology basis for clinical immunotherapy, improve treatment response rates, and extend patient survival time. In addition to large panel gene testing services, the company also provides medium and small panel gene testing services for specific cancer types, including lung cancer, digestive system tumors, breast cancer and gynecological tumors, urological system tumors, central nervous system tumors, and hematolymphoid system tumors, among others. Based on foreign experience, the currently marketed large panel gene testing projects mainly include point mutations, base insertions/deletions, copy number variations, gene fusions, TMB, and MSI. Further, in clinical practice, postoperative follow-up of tumor patients is mainly conducted through imaging examinations. However, imaging examinations have certain requirements for tumor size, which often leads to the discovery of multiple metastases when recurrence is detected. There is an urgent need for new tumor recurrence monitoring biomarkers with higher sensitivity and specificity, which can provide timely intervention when tumor recurrence trends appear, and prolong patient survival. The issuer has independently developed the ATG-seq ultra-high sensitivity liquid biopsy technology, which can effectively reduce various background noises during the detection process. Combined with ultra-high-depth sequencing, it achieves high-specificity sequencing of extremely low-abundance tumor DNA fragments, with a detection limit as low as 0.03%. Using this technology, residual malignant tumor cells in early and middle-stage tumor patients after surgery can be detected, which can effectively guide postoperative recurrence risk stratification and detect tumor recurrence earlier than imaging examinations. The company's liquid biopsy technology, together with the aforementioned large panel pan-cancer gene testing, has established a comprehensive tumor dynamic monitoring service, providing domestic patients with a new choice that is synchronized with international standards. In addition to the above, the company's clinical testing business has also expanded to the field of pathogenic microorganism testing, but the scale of this business is relatively small at the current stage. On the one hand, based on high-throughput metagenomic sequencing technology, the company provides infectious pathogenic microorganism gene testing services, which do not require prior in vitro cultivation and do not depend on prior information. It comprehensively and accurately obtains the gene sequences of pathogenic microorganisms, and can discover new or rare pathogens. It is suitable for scientific research and clinical applications of pathogens with unknown causes, and assists in accurate diagnosis and clinical drug selection for infectious diseases, especially in the treatment of conditionally pathogenic bacteria infections and mixed infections. On the other hand, in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, the company started providing COVID-19 virus nucleic acid testing services and was designated as a testing institution for novel coronavirus by the Nanjing Municipal Health Commission. In July 2021, when the COVID-19 epidemic occurred in Nanjing and surrounding areas, the company actively responded to government demands and quickly established a nucleic acid testing field laboratory, continuously expanding its experimental testing capabilities. 2. Research and development services: (1) Precision medicine customized research services: High-throughput gene testing has also played an important role in tumor scientific research and the clinical trial process of tumor drugs (especially targeted drugs developed for rare mutations). On the one hand, when conducting research in frontier areas such as tumor disease mechanism analysis, gene function understanding, drug target validation, and treatment evaluation, research clients need relevant gene testing services to provide molecular biology basis. On the other hand, high-throughput gene testing can help pharmaceutical companies identify specific gene mutation patients and accelerate the recruitment of clinical trial subjects. Furthermore, pharmaceutical companies often cooperate with high-throughput gene testing companies to jointly promote drug development and clinical trial and registration of companion diagnostic kits, aiming to achieve synergistic effects after market launch and jointly expand the terminal market. With abundant testing experience and a strict quality system, the company provides high-throughput gene testing services to many research institutions, assisting in conducting related basic scientific research. At the same time, the company collaborates with many well-known domestic and foreign innovative pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca, Roche Pharmaceuticals, and BeiGene, to provide multi-level services for their tumor treatment research, new drug trial decision-making, patient enrollment screening, clinical molecular testing, and registration embedding. The tumor precision medicine high-throughput gene testing is integrated into the customer's tumor new drug development process, helping customers accelerate the progress of new drug development and create a new paradigm of ""integrated cancer diagnosis and treatment."" (2) Basic sequencing services: Basic sequencing services are provided by the company to fully utilize the computational capacity of high-throughput sequencing platforms. These services mainly provide high-quality general sequencing services to research clients, including DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, single-cell sequencing, whole-genome methylation sequencing, etc., to meet various research needs in genomics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, and population studies. 3.

508	Zhongzi Environmental Protection Technology Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft)	'通用' translates to 'universal' or 'general' in English.	"The company is a high-tech enterprise specializing in the research, development, production, and sales of environmental catalysts. It is one of the few major domestic manufacturers in the field of catalytic converters for mobile pollution sources (such as vehicles, non-road machinery, ships, etc.), and actively explores the application of its technology in new energy fields such as hydrogen fuel cell catalysts. Currently, foreign environmental catalyst giants such as BASF, Johnson Matthey, and Umicore occupy the majority of the global market share in environmental catalysts, with vehicle exhaust treatment as one of the main application areas. The automotive exhaust treatment catalyst materials have been listed as key strategic new materials urgently needed in China. Through over 15 years of long-term research and development, the company has broken the technological monopoly of foreign environmental catalyst giants and mastered a complete set of core technologies for environmental catalyst materials, including high-performance rare earth oxygen storage materials, high-temperature and high-specific surface area materials, high-dispersion and high-stability precious metal technologies, and advanced coating technologies. It is one of the few domestic manufacturers with China VI automotive exhaust treatment catalyst technology and products. As of June 30, 2020, the company has obtained 10 natural gas engine China VI announcements, 2 diesel engine China VI announcements, and 375 gasoline vehicle announcements. During the reporting period, with the continuous improvement of China's mobile pollution source exhaust emission standards, the company has continued to develop and upgrade key technologies and products, and has successively developed catalytic converters that meet China III to China VI emission standards for vehicles. The company has a full range of exhaust treatment catalyst products for various types of main fuel internal combustion engines, including gasoline, diesel, and natural gas. It has achieved batch supply to mainstream engine manufacturers such as Weichai, Yuchai, Yunnei, Shangchai, Liuzhou Power, Xiaokang Power, and mainstream vehicle manufacturers such as FAW, Dongfeng, Beiqi Foton, and Da Changjiang. In addition, based on the technical accumulation of precious metal catalyst materials, the company has successfully developed hydrogen fuel cell catalysts.

It has won 1 second prize of the National Science and Technology Progress Award and 3 first prizes of provincial and ministerial-level science and technology progress awards. It has presided over or participated in the formulation and revision of 14 relevant industry standards. The company's main products include automotive exhaust treatment catalysts, non-road mobile machinery exhaust treatment catalysts, ship exhaust treatment catalysts, industrial VOCs purification catalysts, and hydrogen fuel cell catalysts. The company's automotive exhaust treatment catalyst products are currently the main products applied to the exhaust treatment of various types of natural gas vehicles, diesel vehicles, gasoline vehicles, and motorcycles. The catalysts are sold in the form of catalytic units or encapsulated products with catalytic units and other components encapsulated in metal shells. The exhaust treatment catalytic unit is the core component of various internal combustion engine exhaust aftertreatment systems, installed downstream of the engine, and converts harmful gases and particulate matter (PM) in the engine exhaust, such as hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), into harmless substances such as water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrogen (N2) through oxidation or reduction catalysis. The exhaust treatment catalytic unit is made by coating a catalyst material mainly composed of catalytic materials and active components on a honeycomb ceramic or metal carrier. The carrier is a column with many small void channels, providing a large specific surface area and suitable pore structure for the catalyst coating, while ensuring sufficient mechanical strength and thermal stability of the catalyst. The catalyst plays a key catalytic role in various chemical reactions for treating harmful substances in exhaust gases, mainly composed of catalytic materials such as rare earth materials, alumina materials, and precious metal materials, as well as additives that enhance the performance of catalytic materials. The performance of exhaust treatment catalysts plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of exhaust treatment. The specific composition, preparation methods, phases, and performance of exhaust treatment catalysts vary for different fuel types and different internal combustion engine models, but there are common core technologies. With the upgrade of exhaust emission standards, higher emission regulations impose higher requirements on the performance of catalysts. The implementation of China's China VI emission standards for vehicles significantly increases the technical development difficulty of exhaust treatment catalyst products that meet the China VI emission standards. 1) Gasoline vehicle exhaust treatment catalyst products. Gasoline vehicles refer to vehicles that use gasoline as fuel. The pollutants in their exhaust mainly include carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbons (THC), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrous oxide (N2O), and particulate matter (PM). The company's gasoline vehicle exhaust treatment catalytic units mainly include three-way catalysts (TWC) and catalytic gasoline particulate filters (cGPF). In the China V emission standard stage, gasoline vehicles generally use the TWC scheme, and in the China VI emission standard stage, gasoline vehicles generally need to use the TWC or TWC+cGPF combination scheme. The catalysts mainly include rare earth oxygen storage materials, modified alumina, platinum, rhodium, and palladium. They catalyze oxidation, reduction, and other reactions to treat pollutants such as total hydrocarbons (THC), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the exhaust. The cGPF refers to a gasoline particulate filter (GPF) with a catalyst coating. The cGPF captures particulate matter (PM) in the exhaust through a wall-flow structure and oxidizes it with the catalyst coating to achieve regeneration. According to customer requirements, the company also provides encapsulation processing for gasoline vehicle exhaust treatment catalytic units, selling the catalytic units in the form of encapsulated products. 2) Diesel vehicle exhaust treatment catalyst products. Diesel vehicles refer to vehicles that use diesel as fuel. The pollutants in their exhaust mainly include carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM). The company's diesel vehicle exhaust treatment catalytic units mainly include diesel oxidation catalysts (DOC), catalytic diesel particulate filters (cDPF), selective catalytic reduction catalysts (SCR), and ammonia slip catalysts (ASC). In the China V emission standard stage, diesel vehicles generally use the SCR, DOC+SCR, or DOC+cDPF schemes, and in the China VI emission standard stage, diesel vehicles generally need to use the DOC+cDPF+SCR+ASC combination scheme. The catalysts mainly include rare earth oxides, transition metal oxides, modified alumina, platinum, and palladium. They catalyze a series of oxidation reactions to treat pollutants such as hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and some particulate matter (PM) in the exhaust. They also promote the passive regeneration of cDPF and the rapid reaction of SCR by oxidizing nitric oxide (NO). When cDPF actively regenerates, the fuel injected into the cylinder or tailpipe undergoes oxidation on the DOC to release heat, providing sufficient heat for active regeneration of cDPF. According to customer requirements, the company also provides encapsulation processing for diesel vehicle exhaust treatment catalytic units, selling the catalytic units in the form of encapsulated products. The product forms mainly include SCR systems, DOC+cDPF systems, DOC+SCR systems, and DOC+cDPF+SCR+ASC systems. 3) Natural gas vehicle exhaust treatment catalyst products. Natural gas vehicles refer to vehicles that use compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG) as fuel. The main chemical component of their fuel is methane (CH4). The pollutants in natural gas vehicle exhaust mainly include carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). According to the combustion mode of natural gas engines, the company provides different exhaust treatment solutions and can produce various catalytic units. For lean-burn natural gas vehicles, the exhaust treatment catalysts mainly include natural gas oxidation catalysts (GOC). For stoichiometric natural gas vehicles, the exhaust treatment catalysts mainly include three-way catalysts (TWC) and ammonia slip catalysts (ASC). In the China V emission standard stage, natural gas vehicles generally use the GOC scheme, and in the China VI emission standard stage, natural gas vehicles mainly use the TWC or TWC+ASC combination scheme. The catalysts mainly include rare earth oxygen storage materials, modified alumina, platinum, rhodium, and palladium. They catalyze oxidation, reduction, and other reactions to treat pollutants such as methane (CH4), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the exhaust. For natural gas engines with stoichiometric combustion, nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the TWC react to produce ammonia (NH3), which is then oxidized by ASC to nitrogen (N2) and water. According to customer requirements, the company also provides encapsulation processing for natural gas vehicle exhaust treatment catalytic units, selling the catalytic units in the form of encapsulated products. 4) Motorcycle exhaust treatment catalyst products. Motorcycles mainly use gasoline as fuel, and the pollutants in their exhaust mainly include carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM). The company's motorcycle exhaust treatment catalyst products mainly include TWC, which can meet the China III, China IV, Euro IV, and other emission standards for motorcycles. The products are made by coating the catalyst layer on a metal carrier. The metal catalytic unit does not require encapsulation processing and can be directly sold as motorcycle exhaust catalytic converters. The catalysts mainly include rare earth oxygen storage materials, modified alumina, platinum, rhodium, and palladium. They convert carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter into water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrogen (N2). Other products of the company include exhaust treatment catalysts for non-road mobile machinery, ship exhaust treatment catalysts, industrial VOCs purification catalysts, and hydrogen fuel cell catalysts. The non-road mobile machinery exhaust treatment system is similar to the diesel engine exhaust treatment system and is used for the exhaust treatment of non-road machinery. In the China III emission standard stage for non-road machinery, exhaust treatment systems are generally not required. In the China IV emission standard stage for non-road machinery, exhaust treatment needs to use the SCR or DOC+cDPF or DOC+cDPF+SCR scheme. The ship exhaust treatment system is similar to the diesel engine exhaust treatment system and is used for the exhaust treatment of ships. Currently, ship exhaust treatment generally uses the SCR scheme. The industrial VOCs purification catalyst is made of platinum group precious metals or transition metals such as manganese and cobalt, high-performance rare earth oxygen storage materials, and high-temperature and high-specific surface area materials. It is used for the treatment of exhaust gases emitted by industries such as chemical, printing, machinery, electronics, automobile manufacturing and maintenance, and insulation materials, which contain aromatic hydrocarbons, oxygen-containing organic compounds, carbon monoxide (CO), and other harmful toxins. The company's hydrogen fuel cell catalyst is made by uniformly distributing platinum or platinum group metal nanoparticles on a carbon carrier. It is the core material of fuel cell stacks and is used to prepare the catalytic layer in membrane electrode assemblies. Hydrogen and oxygen undergo electrochemical reactions on the catalytic layer, converting chemical energy into electrical energy, with water as the product."

Company Business Overview and Composition. Ant Group is the parent company of Alipay, China's largest mobile payment platform, and a leading open platform for financial technology. It is committed to driving the digital upgrade of the global modern service industry, including the financial services industry, through technology and innovation. Ant Group partners with various stakeholders to provide inclusive, green, and sustainable services to consumers and small and micro businesses, bringing about positive changes in the world. The name is crucial to us. The company is China's leading digital payment provider and digital financial technology platform. As of June 30, 2020, the total payment transaction volume completed through the company's platform reached 118 trillion yuan. The company's digital payment service revenue mainly comes from transaction service fees charged to merchants based on a certain percentage of the transaction amount. Against the backdrop of the global economy accelerating its digital transformation, the company also provides cross-border payment services to meet related needs. As of June 30, 2020, the total international payment transaction volume completed through the company's platform reached 621.9 billion yuan. Alipay's app serves over 1 billion users and over 80 million merchants. With a wide user base, the company provides digital financial technology support, customer reach, and risk management solutions to financial institution partners, enabling them to provide consumer credit, credit for small and micro businesses, wealth management, and insurance services. In China, the financial needs of consumers and small and micro businesses are not fully met, and the company's services create significant value for them. Consumers can access comprehensive services, including digital payment services, consumer credit, wealth management, and insurance, as well as daily life services provided by third parties, such as food delivery, transportation, entertainment, and convenience services. Merchants can accept payments, access digital financial services (such as credit for small and micro businesses and wealth management products), and provide daily life services to consumers through the Alipay app and over 2 million mini-programs. Users can easily discover and use these mini-programs and life services through Alipay's search or by adding personalized applications. Based on the company's intelligent business decision-making solutions, dynamic risk management solutions, and technological infrastructure support, financial institutions provide credit, wealth management, and insurance services through the company's platform. The company provides technical support and collaboration to financial institutions, rather than competing with them. 1 Calculated based on the total payment transaction volume and the business scale of digital financial transactions, according to research by iResearch and Oliver Wyman. For users, the Alipay app is not only a digital payment tool but also an entry point for digital financial services and digital life services. Digital payment is the infrastructure for consumers' daily life and digital finance, playing a crucial role in expanding Alipay's reach to online and offline users. The convenient and rich digital life services provided by the Alipay app are of great significance for increasing user activity and retention. Our digital financial services are highly innovative and attractive to users, with a high degree of synergy with digital payment and digital life services. The combination of digital payment, digital finance, and digital life services creates a powerful force and a virtuous cycle, serving as an important driver of the company's growth. The comprehensive service platform formed by digital payment, digital finance, and digital life services is collectively referred to as the company's Alipay platform. With China's economic transformation driven by domestic consumption and the rise of small and micro businesses, the demand for financial services from consumers and small and micro businesses is rapidly growing, and it is expected that the demand for credit, wealth management, and insurance products will continue to increase significantly in the future. Due to the limitations of offline channels in the financial system, customer insights are relatively limited, making it difficult to fully serve these needs (such as small loans and small insurance policies). The company collaborates with financial institution partners to leverage its own technological capabilities and high-quality customer insights to support the digital development of the financial industry. At the same time, the digitization of financial services creates new opportunities for financial institutions to discover and meet customer needs in real-time and serve a broader customer base more efficiently. Based on the extensive reach of the Alipay platform, the company aims to build the ""capillaries"" of financial services, providing strong support to the ""arteries"" of financial institutions. The company helps financial institutions reach a wider range of users, obtain technical support, and achieve more efficient resource allocation through its platform model, thereby realizing the social goals of inclusiveness and sustainable development. The company supports financial institution partners in the following areas: Extensive and precise reach and connection: Through customer insights and the Alipay app, the company helps financial institution partners reach over 1 billion users and provide personalized financial services to meet their needs. Intelligent business decision-making system: The company's self-developed intelligent business decision-making solutions help financial institutions better assess risks and match products with customers. The company has unique customer insights into consumers and small and micro businesses, and combines multiple risk assessment algorithms for real-time updates, thereby improving credit assessment. Ability to cover and recommend wealth management and insurance products: For example, the company's solutions can assess the borrower's repayment ability and willingness, the probability of accepting product recommendations, and the suitability of product features and pricing for individual users. Dynamic risk management system: The company's developed dynamic risk management solutions optimize the decision-making process of financial institutions. The company's solutions and algorithms help financial institutions better address key business risks, such as customer identification, fraud risk, anti-money laundering, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, security, and data privacy risks. Technological infrastructure: Through research and investment in artificial intelligence, algorithms and analytics, computing, and AntChain, the company provides technical support to financial institution partners, enabling them to serve customers securely, efficiently, and at scale. The company's capabilities are mainly applied in the following three areas of digital finance: Microloan technology platform, serving consumer credit and credit needs of small and micro businesses. The company's microloan technology platform primarily targets underserved or underserved consumer and small and micro business groups, serving their unmet credit needs. Customers initiate loan requests through the company's technology platform, and banking partners make independent credit decisions and disburse loans accordingly. Financial institution partners pay technology service fees to the company based on the credit volume facilitated by the company's platform. In this process, the company's business model is based on open collaboration, rather than conducting business or providing guarantees using its own balance sheet. The company uses technology to assist financial institution partners in providing credit services to small and micro businesses, farmers, and consumers. The financial institutions independently make credit decisions and bear the risks. As of June 30, 2020, approximately 98% of the credit balance facilitated by the company's platform was either disbursed by the company's financial institution partners or securitized. The company is China's largest online consumer credit and small and micro business credit platform1.

Wealth management technology platform, serving wealth management needs. The company assists asset management institution partners in providing transparent, personalized, simple, and low-threshold wealth management options to a wide range of consumers. The company's technology matches wealth management products based on customer risk preferences. The company's large user base, technological capabilities, customer insights, and consumer trust in the company's brand help financial institution partners offer diversified and innovative wealth management products to a broader user base. Financial institution partners pay technology service fees to the company based on the asset management volume facilitated by the company's platform. The company is China's largest online wealth management service platform1. As of June 30, 2020, the asset management volume facilitated by the company's wealth management technology platform reached 4.0986 trillion yuan, and it has collaborated with approximately 170 asset management companies, including the majority of fund companies in China, leading insurance companies, banks, and securities firms. Insurance technology platform, serving insurance needs. The company assists insurance company partners in providing a wide range of innovative, customized, easily accessible insurance products, covering life insurance, health insurance, and property insurance products. The ongoing digitalization trend in the Chinese economy provides opportunities for transformation in the insurance sector. With sufficient and high-quality data, any risk-bearing activity can be insured. The company's platform and the scale of the Alibaba ecosystem are closely related to commercial activities, enabling the company to explore innovative insurance products to fully meet the needs of consumers and merchants. Insurance company partners pay technology service fees to the company based on the premium and sharing amount facilitated by the company's platform. The company is China's largest online insurance service platform2. As of June 30, 2020, the premium and sharing amount facilitated by the company's platform reached 51.8 billion yuan during the 12-month period. As of June 30, 2020, the company has collaborated with approximately 90 insurance institutions. 2. Company's Ecosystem.

695	Shanghai Zhuoran Engineering Technology Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft)	'通用' translates to 'universal' or 'general' in English.	"The company's main products include ethylene cracking furnaces, conversion furnaces, refining heating furnaces, waste heat boilers, pressure vessels, other supporting products, and related technical services. Among them, ethylene cracking furnaces and conversion furnaces are petrochemical specialized equipment, refining heating furnaces and waste heat boilers are refining specialized equipment, and pressure vessels are general equipment in the refining and chemical industry. Therefore, pressure vessels are classified as other products and services along with other supporting products and related technical services. For engineering general contracting services, the revenue from this category is classified as engineering general contracting services. The ethylene cracking furnace is a key and core process equipment in the ethylene plant, with large investment, high energy consumption, and high technological barriers. Ethylene, represented by olefins, is the basic raw material for modern petrochemical industry production, accounting for about three-quarters of the total raw materials consumed in the petrochemical industry. In 2019, global ethylene production reached 170 million tons. Due to its special position in the ethylene plant, the ethylene cracking furnace is also a leading chemical production unit and plays a very important role in the modern petrochemical industry. The company has been deeply involved in the performance of core furnace tubes and overall production processes for many years, with deep technical accumulation in centrifugal casting equipment for furnace tubes, durability of furnace tube materials for tens of thousands of hours, and modular integrated manufacturing technology for refining and chemical equipment. As a result, the company has formed a large-scale modular and integrated production and supply mode for large-scale refining and chemical specialized equipment with ethylene cracking furnaces as the core product. At the same time, the company provides customers with engineering general contracting services, engineering consulting, engineering management services, and technical development services for related equipment. Night view of the ethylene cracking furnace in the 1 million tons/year ethylene plant project in Baolai, Liaoning. (1) Ethylene cracking furnace. The ethylene cracking furnace can be divided into gas cracking furnaces and liquid cracking furnaces. Its main function is to process various raw materials such as natural gas, refinery gas, crude oil, and naphtha into cracked gas and provide it to other ethylene units, ultimately producing ethylene, propylene, and various by-products. The cracking furnace mainly consists of a convection section, a radiant section (including radiant tubes and burners), and a quench boiler system. The process flow can be roughly divided into two parts: cracking and quenching-distillation. After preheating, the raw materials are mixed with dilution steam (or superheated steam) in different proportions depending on the raw materials. Then, the mixture is heated to 500-600°C in the convection section of the tubular furnace and further heated in the radiant section until the heating temperature in the radiant tubes reaches 780-900°C, causing cracking to occur. The cracked products coming out of the radiant section then enter the quench boiler to prevent secondary reactions. The temperature is rapidly reduced in the quench boiler, generating high-pressure steam and recovering heat. When the temperature of the cracked products in the quench boiler drops to 350-600°C, further cooling is carried out to separate basic petrochemical raw materials such as ethylene, propylene, butadiene, benzene, toluene, and xylene. In the ethylene unit, the comprehensive energy consumption of the cracking furnace accounts for about 50% to 60% of the comprehensive energy consumption of the ethylene unit. The investment in the cracking furnace accounts for about 1/4 to 1/3 of the total investment in the ethylene unit, making it undoubtedly the leading equipment in the entire ethylene unit. In recent years, China's petrochemical industry has developed rapidly. Starting from the 300,000 tons/year ethylene unit in the 1980s, after several rounds of transformation and upgrading, the 1 million tons/year ethylene unit has become the main unit in China today. Through years of scientific research, the relevant key equipment has basically achieved independent design and manufacturing. At present, the main differences between China's ethylene production enterprises and leading foreign manufacturers are in the innovation of new furnace tube materials and structural design, as well as the innovation of design and manufacturing integration, modular integrated production processes, and informationization. The company aims to develop advanced technology in the fields of process design, engineering design, and manufacturing design to create large-scale green manufacturing of complete sets of ethylene cracking furnace equipment. The company's large-scale anti-coking ethylene cracking furnace has successively obtained support from major scientific and technological achievements transformation projects in Jiangsu Province, National 863 Program, and National Major Scientific Instruments and Equipment Development. It has won the Jiangsu Province Science and Technology Progress Award and the first set of equipment in Jiangsu Province. In March 2015, in the evaluation of the modularization technology of the cracking furnace by the Technology Department of China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation, Zhuoran participated in the complete technology of modular design, manufacturing, and installation of the cracking furnace. The application of modularization ensures the manufacturing quality of the cracking furnace equipment, reduces external heat loss from the convection section by about 0.57%, and saves about 50% of on-site construction manpower. The on-site construction period is 10% to 20% of the traditional period, which has significant economic and social benefits and is a domestic first. In May 2016, in the evaluation of the performance and application of rare earth heat-resistant steel furnace tubes for cracking by the Technology Department of China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation, Zhuoran led the development of rare earth heat-resistant steel furnace tubes. Compared with ordinary heat-resistant steel furnace tubes, the anti-coking performance is significantly improved, fuel consumption is reduced by 1.5%, and the operating cycle is extended by 37%, resulting in significant economic and social benefits. In 2019, the company's ""Development and Application of 1 Million Tons Ethylene Cracking Flue Gas Emission Reduction Control Technology"" passed the scientific and technological achievement appraisal organized by the China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Association. Zhuoran has developed proprietary technology for centrifugal casting with rare earth additives and based on this, successfully developed a new type of anti-coking rare earth heat-resistant steel furnace tube, realizing the industrial application demonstration of the entire rare earth heat-resistant steel furnace tube for the first time. In 2013, the company completed the export of the ""Malaysia Titan 90,000 tons/year ethylene cracking furnace project"", which was the first complete set of equipment exported with independent design from China, using the process of China Petroleum Engineering Construction Corporation (SEI). The project broke the long-term monopoly of foreign companies in the international market for ethylene cracking specialized equipment. In June 2016, the company successfully completed the ""Zhonghai Huilian Phase II 1 million tons/year ethylene plant project"", which was the first large-scale modular supply of cracking furnaces. In this project, after prefabrication, overall assembly, and installation of refractory materials in the factory, the cracking furnace was divided into two complete modules and transported to the site by sea, achieving the maximum degree of modularization. In 2019, in the ""Zhejiang Petrochemical Refining and Chemical Integration Project Phase II 3# 1.4 million tons/year ethylene plant"", which was supplied by Zhuoran, there were a total of nine 200,000 tons/year ethylene cracking furnaces. Through detailed coordination, the company broke the traditional manufacturing mode and adopted a supply mode of integrated modular construction, integrated installation at the dock, and delivery of complete furnaces and modules by sea to solve the problems of no prefabrication site at the project site and short construction period. This achieved the maximum degree of modular supply and received high recognition from the owner. (2) Conversion furnace. The conversion furnace is a type of heating furnace in the refinery that is structurally complex, expensive, and operates under harsh conditions. Water vapor and hydrocarbons enter the furnace tubes of the conversion furnace and undergo conversion reactions under high temperature and catalytic action, producing H₂, CO, and CO₂. The furnace tubes have the characteristics of both reactors and pressure vessels. As the core equipment of hydrogen production, carbon monoxide production, and methanol production units, the conversion furnace can be divided into top-fired furnaces, side-fired furnaces, and staged furnaces. The company's conversion furnace products include hydrogen production conversion furnaces, methanol conversion furnaces, CO conversion furnaces, and ammonia synthesis conversion furnaces. The conversion furnace is a very special externally heated tubular reactor. Due to the strong endothermic and high-temperature characteristics of the conversion reaction, this reactor is designed in the form of a heating furnace, with catalysts installed inside the conversion furnace tubes. The reaction medium undergoes reactions in the catalyst bed inside the furnace tubes by direct heating in the furnace chamber. The demanding operating conditions of the conversion furnace make it have many special characteristics different from other heating furnaces. Various aspects such as furnace structure, furnace tube materials, pipeline system support, pipeline system stress, pipeline system expansion and compensation, combustion, flue gas flow and distribution, and refractory materials must be carefully considered. In 2009, the company successfully delivered the ""Yangzi Petrochemical 120,000 BPD HyCO Conversion Furnace"", which was the first time that the complete set of equipment was manufactured in a modular manner. In 2011, the company successfully delivered the ""Lanzhou Petrochemical 50,000 BPD Hydrogen Production Conversion Furnace"", realizing the overall supply mode of factory manufacturing and on-site installation for the first time. In 2014, the company successfully completed the manufacturing and installation tasks of the ""Sinochem Quanzhou 12 million tons/year Refining Project 140,000 BPD Hydrogen Production Unit"" and was awarded the PC Sample Project Award by the owner. In 2015, the company successfully completed the ""Huabei Petrochemical 2x80,000 BPD Hydrogen Production Conversion Furnace"", which was symmetrically arranged by two 80,000 BPD hydrogen production units. The petroleum refining process includes physical processes such as distillation and extraction, as well as chemical processes such as cracking, condensation, and conversion. These processes require a large amount of heat to complete, and the refining heating furnace is the equipment that provides heat for these processes. Its heat supply directly affects the product yield of subsequent distillation towers or the reaction depth of subsequent reactors, thereby affecting the final product yield. The company's heating furnace products include: constant pressure heating furnaces, reforming heating furnaces, delayed coking heating furnaces, residue oil hydrogenation heating furnaces, wax oil hydrogenation heating furnaces, diesel oil hydrogenation heating furnaces, gasoline hydrogen desulfurization heating furnaces, steam superheaters, and incinerators. In the refining heating furnace, the atmospheric and vacuum distillation unit is the primary processing unit for crude oil, and its processing capacity determines the processing capacity or scale of the entire refinery. In the atmospheric and vacuum distillation unit, the processing capacity of the atmospheric and vacuum furnaces determines the processing capacity of the atmospheric and vacuum distillation unit. If the processing capacity of the atmospheric and vacuum furnaces is insufficient, the entire unit will not be able to complete the intended tasks. In this sense, the processing capacity of the atmospheric and vacuum furnaces determines the processing capacity or scale of the entire production unit or even the entire refinery and petrochemical enterprise. The reforming heating furnace is the core of the reforming unit and is mainly used for secondary processing of petroleum. Under the conditions of heating, hydrogen pressure, and catalyst, the reforming unit converts the naphtha obtained from crude oil distillation into high-octane gasoline rich in aromatics (reformed gasoline), and also produces liquefied petroleum gas and hydrogen gas as by-products. Reformed gasoline can be directly used as a blending component for gasoline, or it can be used to extract benzene, toluene, and xylene through aromatic hydrocarbon extraction. The by-product hydrogen gas is an important source of hydrogen for hydrogenation units in petroleum refineries. Catalytic reforming is an important means to improve gasoline quality and produce petrochemical raw materials. It is one of the most common units in modern petroleum refineries and petrochemical joint enterprises. In May 2018, the steam superheater of the ""Zhejiang Petrochemical Refining and Chemical Integration Project Phase I 1.2 million tons/year styrene plant"" designed and manufactured by the company achieved the supply mode of integrated installation at the dock, complete furnace delivery by sea, and on-site installation. In June 2018, the ""Zhejiang Petrochemical Refining and Chemical Integration Project Phase II 3.8 million tons/year reforming heating furnace"" also adopted a one-stop delivery mode of factory modular design and manufacturing, integrated assembly at the dock, complete furnace delivery by sea, and hydraulic jacking in place at the site. This supply mode greatly compressed the project schedule, reduced project costs, and reduced the risk of working at heights. (3) Waste heat boiler. As an important part of the waste heat and exhaust heat system in industrial production, the waste heat boiler is a key equipment for energy saving and emission reduction. The company's waste heat boilers are mainly used in refining specialized equipment, including catalytic waste heat boilers, convection section flue gas waste heat boilers, and turbine exhaust gas waste heat boilers."

597	Hefei Qizhong Technology Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft)	High-end equipment	"The company is mainly engaged in advanced packaging and testing of integrated circuits, focusing on the field of display driver chip packaging and testing, as well as non-display chip packaging and testing represented by power management chips and RF front-end chips. 1. Display driver chip packaging and testing business: This is a key area of development for the company. Display driver chips are one of the main control components of display panels, often referred to as the ""brain"" of the display panel. Their main function is to send driving signals and data to the display panel in the form of electrical signals, controlling the brightness and color of the screen to present images such as letters and pictures. As display panel resolutions and clarity increase, display driver chips need to handle larger amounts of data. The use of bump manufacturing technology, which is one of the core technologies in modern advanced packaging, allows for the creation of millions of extremely small bumps on the wafer surface to replace traditional wire bonding, meeting the high I/O requirements of display driver chips. Gold bump manufacturing technology is widely used in the packaging of display driver chips due to gold's good conductivity, processability, and corrosion resistance. After the completion of gold bump manufacturing, the wafers undergo wafer testing (CP) and then proceed to different packaging processes such as glass cover (COG), flexible screen cover (COP), and thin film cover (COF). The micro bumps made on the wafer bonding pads through processes such as vacuum sputtering, photolithography, electroplating, and etching are an extension of technology in the upstream wafer manufacturing field. They greatly improve chip electrical performance, increase current transmission efficiency, and reduce resistance and thermal resistance. Due to the high requirements for line accuracy and heat dissipation in display driver chips, gold bump manufacturing technology can meet these needs and is widely used in the field of display driver chip packaging. The company's gold bump manufacturing process can achieve a minimum pitch of 6μm and produce millions of bumps on a 12-inch wafer. The hardness of the bumps can exceed 105HV (Vickers hardness), making them suitable for AMOLED display driver chips in COP packaging. Each chip on the wafer undergoes functional parameter testing using specialized testing equipment to ensure that it meets the design specifications. This process allows for the identification of defective chips before wafer dicing, avoiding further processing on non-conforming chips. Chip testing plays an essential role in the integrated circuit industry, as every chip needs to undergo 100% testing to ensure its normal operation. The company's testing process has an efficient automated management system and engineering capabilities, providing a testing environment ranging from -55℃ to 150℃ and a testing frequency of up to 5Gbps, meeting the testing requirements of high-performance chips. The company's display driver chip packaging and testing business includes chips with only display driver functions (DDI). After testing, the wafers are ground and diced, and the diced chips are placed in special trays for panel manufacturers to package them on glass substrates (COG) or flexible screens (COP). For the company, the process flow and shipment form of COG and COP packaging are similar. COG is suitable for small and medium-sized panels such as mobile phones and tablets. It has mature technology and significant cost advantages. COP is mainly used for curved or foldable AMOLED screens. It is an advanced panel packaging technology and the mainstream technology for future display panel development, but it has relatively higher costs. The company's COG/COP process can grind chips as thin as 50μm, effectively reducing the package size and improving chip performance. Additionally, the company can provide cutting processes such as diamond dicing and laser scribing in conjunction with advanced processes from wafer fabs. After testing, the wafers are ground and diced, and the diced chips are inverted onto a tape film, which is then bonded to the gold bumps on the film through thermal compression bonding. After the completion of packaging, the chips undergo final testing (FT) and are provided to panel manufacturers for subsequent processes. Chips packaged using this process have characteristics such as low impedance, high density, high heat dissipation performance, small size, and flexibility. They are mainly used in large-sized panels such as televisions and monitors, with a small portion used in small-sized panels such as smartphones with full screens. COF packaging has relatively higher costs but can achieve a higher screen-to-body ratio. It is suitable for both LCD and AMOLED hard screen packaging. The company's COF process can achieve a fine pitch of 12μm, providing customers with different heat dissipation solutions. It has also pioneered the 125mm large-area wafer-level chip packaging technology, featuring double-sided copper structure, multi-chip packaging, and other advanced capabilities to meet the requirements of future high-end display technologies. Touch and display driver integrated chips (TDDI) can be used for both LCD and AMOLED mainstream display panels. The main difference between the two lies in the fact that LCD emits white light through a backlight layer and controls the light through the liquid crystal layer, while AMOLED directly displays light through an organic self-luminous layer. Panels carrying the company's tested chips are widely used in fields such as high-definition televisions, smartphones, laptops, smart wearable devices, tablets, industrial control, and automotive electronics. 2. Non-display chip packaging and testing business: Bump manufacturing technology is the foundation for the realization and further development of various advanced packaging technologies. After years of development, the metal materials and processes used in bump manufacturing have evolved, and different metal materials and bump structures can meet the packaging needs of different types of chips. Leveraging the company's accumulation in the field of display driver chip packaging and testing and its deep understanding of bump manufacturing technology, the company expanded its business to the field of non-display chip packaging and testing in 2015. This field has become a key component and focus of the company's business development. The company can now provide customers with various bump manufacturing and wafer testing services, including copper pillar bumps (CuPillar), copper-nickel-gold bumps (CuNiAuBumping), and tin bumps (SnBumping). It can also provide back-end DPS packaging services, forming a complete fan-in wafer-level chip size packaging (Fan-inWLCSP) solution. The bump structure mainly consists of copper pillars and solder caps and requires processes such as sputtering, photolithography, electroplating, etching, and re-passivation. The addition of a passivation layer greatly enhances the chip's corrosion resistance, breakdown resistance, and buffering capacity. The chip surface lines can also be rearranged through additional redistribution layer processes. The company can provide Fan-inWLCSP solutions based on copper pillar bumps. Copper-nickel-gold bumps are manufactured using the basic wafer bump manufacturing process, with a copper-nickel-gold thickness exceeding 10μm.

616	Jiangsu Feiwotai Nanotechnology Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft)	High-end equipment	Based on years of technical accumulation and industry experience, the company has formed advantages in the field of nanocoating equipment, materials, and preparation processes. It provides customers with customized solutions based on nanofilm products. Currently, the company's nanofilm product series includes single-layer liquid-resistant nanofilms, double-layer liquid and gas-resistant nanofilms, and multi-layer corrosion-resistant nanofilms. The company's nanofilm products are based on the independently developed planetary rotary vacuum nanocoating equipment, relying on specific coating material formulations and processes to prepare nanofilms that meet specific requirements for customer products.1. Planetary rotary vacuum nanocoating equipment:(1) Overview of nanocoating equipment: During the reporting period, the company independently designed and produced six models of nanocoating equipment, of which four models, FT-35X, FT36X, FT-35XMC, and FT-36S, have achieved mass production and are used for preparing nanofilms. As of the date of this prospectus, two models of nanocoating equipment, FT-1680 and FT-900, have been produced as physical validation machines. During the reporting period, the company's nanocoating equipment was used to prepare nanofilms for customers and was not sold externally. The 600L equipment can accommodate objects with a maximum size of approximately 350mm*300mm*50mm. It is suitable for preparing nanofilms with functions such as hydrophobicity and oil repellency. It has been mass-produced and used for preparing nanofilms.

It is suitable for preparing nanofilms with larger film thickness and corrosion resistance for normal-sized objects to be coated. The small vacuum coating equipment has a coating chamber volume of 100L and can accommodate objects with a maximum size of approximately 350mm*300mm*50mm. It is equipped with a 6-channel monomer system, which can simultaneously introduce 6 types of chemical materials (other equipment generally has 3-4 channels), meeting various research and development process requirements. It is suitable for preparing nanofilms with functions such as waterproofing, corrosion resistance, and sulfur resistance for small-sized objects. It has been used for small-scale production and preparing nanofilms. It is suitable for preparing nanofilms with functions such as liquid resistance, gas resistance, and corrosion resistance for extra-large-sized objects. The equipment has been produced as a physical validation machine but has not been used for preparing nanofilms.2. Working principle of nanocoating equipment: The main process principles used by the company in the preparation of nanofilms are plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and plasma polymerization. PECVD utilizes microwave or radio frequency energy to ionize gases containing film component elements, generating highly chemically active plasma, and depositing films with desired functions on substrates. Plasma polymerization utilizes plasma energy to ionize and decompose organic gaseous raw materials and undergo polymerization reactions while in a plasma state. The reaction process for preparing nanofilms is completed in the nanocoating equipment. The company's nanocoating equipment consists of nine major systems: lifting and rotating system, vacuum pressure system, process gas system, chemical monomer system, plasma power supply system, planetary rotary system, signal control system, exhaust system, and reaction chamber system. The process of nanofilm preparation and the functions of each system in the nanocoating equipment during the process are as follows: 1) The lifting and rotating system sends the placed objects into the reaction chamber system through the lifting platform. 2) The vacuum pressure system uses a vacuum pump to evacuate the air in the coating equipment chamber, providing a vacuum environment for the reaction process. 3) The process gas system introduces process gases (such as helium and argon) used to generate plasma into the reaction chamber system. 4) The chemical monomer system vaporizes the chemical materials used to form nanofilms and introduces them into the reaction chamber system. 5) The plasma power supply system discharges to ionize the process gases and generate plasma, providing energy for the deposition process. 6) The planetary rotary system allows the objects to rotate around the central axis and rotate around the planetary axis, ensuring uniform deposition of plasma polymer on the substrate through continuous dual rotation. 7) The signal control system uses the company's independently developed core control algorithm to achieve automation control during the reaction process. The signal control system monitors real-time data feedback from sensors such as equipment pressure, temperature, and flow rate, automatically adjusts process parameters such as RF power, discharge frequency, and chamber pressure based on pre-set process parameters, controls the crosslinking degree and branching degree of the deposited polymer nanofilms, and deposits nanofilms with different functional properties. 8) The exhaust system continuously removes by-products generated during the reaction process and safely discharges them after filtration. 9) The reaction chamber system is where the deposition reaction occurs. With the cooperation of the above systems, the deposition process is completed in the reaction chamber system of the nanocoating equipment. The specific process is as follows: Plasma releases energy to act on the chemical material gas, forming specific molecular functional groups, and also acts on the surface of the object to generate free radicals. The functional groups and free radicals on the object's surface continuously combine to form a nanofilm with a thickness of up to nanometers. The structure diagram of the Fivota nanocoating equipment reaction chamber is shown.3. Nanofilm products: Nanofilm products are prepared by applying the company's nanocoating equipment, customized material formulations, and preparation processes to deposit and polymerize a layer of nanofilm on the customer's objects based on the customer's requirements for film functionality and performance. Since the thickness of the company's nanofilm products can reach the nanometer level and must adhere closely to the surface of the customer's coated objects without existing independently, the solutions provided by the company based on nanofilms have both product and customization service attributes. The main types of nanofilm products that generated the company's main business revenue during the reporting period are as follows:(1) Single-layer liquid-resistant nanofilms: Single-layer liquid-resistant nanofilms can prevent liquid droplets from staying on the surface of the substrate and instead form droplets that slide off due to their liquid-resistant properties. The contact angle between the substrate surface and the liquid directly reflects its liquid-resistant performance: contact angle θ < 90° indicates hydrophilicity of the substrate surface; contact angle θ > 90° indicates hydrophobicity of the substrate surface, and the larger the contact angle, the better the hydrophobicity. Under certain pore size conditions, the larger the contact angle θ, the easier it is for the pores to block water droplets using the surface tension of water, preventing water droplets from penetrating through the pores. After the company's coating treatment, the water droplet angle on the substrate surface can reach a hydrophobic effect of more than 90 degrees, providing good protection for the coated substrate. The single-layer liquid-resistant nanofilms can make the product surface hydrophobic and oil-repellent, exhibiting repellency to water, oil, beverages, and other liquids, preventing liquid droplets from penetrating into the product through the pores. Due to the low thickness of the film layer, single-layer liquid-resistant nanofilms have good heat dissipation properties, do not affect the signals of smart terminal products, and do not affect the optical characteristics and color of the substrate. They are mainly suitable for life waterproof applications of whole machines or external components of various electronic products, such as complete electronic products (such as complete mobile phones, complete headphones, complete headphone charging cases, etc.) and external components of electronic products (such as speaker covers).

645	Shanghai Bide Pharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft)	High-end equipment	The company's main products are drug molecular building blocks and scientific reagents, both of which directly serve the process of new drug development for customers. New drug development companies need to screen, evaluate, and optimize thousands of candidate compounds. The compounds used for screening, evaluation, and optimization are formed by connecting multiple drug molecular building blocks through chemical synthesis. Each type of drug molecular building block has different properties and functions, which can be used to improve physical and chemical properties, biological activity, pharmacokinetic properties, and toxicological properties. Therefore, the compounds used for screening, evaluation, and optimization also exhibit different characteristics. New drug development companies conduct extensive screening, evaluation, and optimization of these candidate compounds to obtain promising compounds (HIT), lead compounds (LEAD), and clinical candidate drugs (Clinical Candidate) with research value. Therefore, in the early stages of new drug development, a wide variety and large quantity of drug molecular building blocks that are innovative and novel are needed. The individual dosage of these drug molecular building block products is often small, but they have high unit value. As new drug development projects progress, the variety of related drug molecular building block products will gradually decrease, the quantity will gradually increase, and the unit price of drug molecular building block products will also gradually decrease with the increase in quantity. Drug molecular building blocks help to quickly discover the structure-activity and structure-property relationships of compounds, improving the efficiency and success rate of new drug development. Scientific reagents refer to reagents that do not directly participate in compound construction but are indispensable in the process of new drug development. The company's drug molecular building blocks are classified into benzene ring, heterocyclic, and alkyl group based on their molecular structural characteristics. Scientific reagents are classified into catalysts, ligands, and active small molecule compounds based on their functions. The main products of the company are as follows: including drug molecular building blocks ranging from milligrams to kilograms, mainly including benzene ring, heterocyclic, and alkyl group building blocks, etc. Heterocyclic building blocks include aromatic heterocycles and non-aromatic heterocycles. Drug molecular building blocks are mainly used in key stages of new drug development such as drug target discovery, screening and optimization of promising compounds, screening and optimization of lead compounds, and determination of clinical candidates.

701	Qingdao Yunlu Advanced Materials Technology Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft)	High-end equipment	"(1) Overview of main business and basic information of major products and revenue composition. 1. Overview of main business: Since its establishment, the company has been focusing on the design, research and development, production, and sales of advanced magnetic metal materials. It has formed three major materials and product series: amorphous alloys, nanocrystalline alloys, and magnetic powders. These products include amorphous alloy strips and cores, nanocrystalline ultra-thin strips, atomized and crushed powders, and magnetic powder cores. Currently, the company holds the largest market share in the global amorphous alloy strip market and is a leading enterprise in the amorphous alloy material industry. While continuously developing new material products, the company is also expanding into the field of material product deep processing, aiming to become a comprehensive solution provider for the research, production, and application of advanced magnetic metal materials. Through continuous research and development and technological innovation, the company has independently developed and mastered extreme manufacturing technologies such as ""small flow rate molten precision continuous casting technology"" and ""extreme condensation control technology"" as the core, and the magnetic metal materials produced are mainly used in the production of energy-saving distribution transformers and electronic devices for electromagnetic energy conversion.

In 2019, the company was included in the list of national intellectual property advantage enterprises, and in 2020, it was listed as a ""demonstration enterprise for scientific and technological innovation"" by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council. 2. Overview of main products: Based on long-term development in the field of amorphous alloy strips, the company continues to develop new products in the field of magnetic materials, such as nanocrystalline ultra-thin strips and magnetic powders, to enrich its product structure and explore new market space beyond the traditional downstream power industry. At the same time, in order to improve the application quality of the company's magnetic materials and meet the needs of downstream end customers, the company further enriches its product categories and expands the production and sales of amorphous cores and magnetic powder cores. According to the BCCResearch research report, the global market space of the soft magnetic materials industry reached 51.4 billion US dollars in 2019, indicating a broad market space. Currently, the Asia-Pacific region occupies a central position in the global magnetic materials industry. Japanese companies such as TDK, Hitachi Metals, and Toda represent the industry's technological leadership. China, as an important production base for magnetic materials, has rapidly developed its magnetic materials industry in recent years and continuously strengthened its overall strength. With the continuous improvement of technology in the downstream power electronics field and the continuous promotion of the green and low-carbon development concept, emerging industries such as new energy vehicles, consumer electronics, and new energy generation are gradually emerging. These industries have higher standards and requirements for magnetic devices that undertake the function of energy conversion, such as weight, volume, and transmission efficiency. Traditional magnetic materials such as ferrite are difficult to meet the requirements of these new industries, while new generation magnetic materials such as nanocrystalline ultra-thin strips are gradually replacing them and are expected to further expand the market space in the future. So far, the company has formed three major business segments, including amorphous alloys, nanocrystalline alloys, and magnetic powders. (1) Amorphous alloy segment: The company's amorphous alloy segment mainly includes amorphous alloy strips and their products, such as amorphous cores. Amorphous cores are the core components of amorphous transformers and are mainly used in the power distribution field. As a leading enterprise in the amorphous alloy material industry, the company has maintained a leading market share in the domestic market during the reporting period. At the same time, it has actively expanded into overseas countries and regions with strong power demand, such as India, South Korea, and Vietnam. The excellent energy-saving and environmental protection characteristics of amorphous alloy products have been recognized by power system supporting enterprises in the above-mentioned countries. At the same time, the company's research and development of amorphous alloy three-dimensional wound cores and industrialization technology have promoted the technological progress of energy-saving distribution transformers and enhanced the competitive advantage of amorphous alloy transformers over silicon steel transformers. Currently, amorphous three-dimensional wound transformers have been put into operation in the State Grid Corporation of China. With the emergence of the promotion effect of amorphous three-dimensional wound transformers, new growth points are expected to be brought to the market space of amorphous alloy strip products. 1) Amorphous alloy strip: Amorphous alloy, also known as ""liquid metal"" or ""metal glass,"" is produced by rapidly cooling the alloy melt at a rate of millions of degrees per second using rapid quenching technology. This process produces amorphous alloy strips with a thickness of about 0.03mm, which exhibit a physical state of long-range disordered arrangement of metal atoms. Thanks to the special atomic structure formed by the extreme production process mentioned above, amorphous alloys have excellent properties such as low coercivity, high magnetic permeability, and high electrical resistivity. Amorphous alloy strips were first industrialized in the United States and Japan in the 1960s, and domestic industrialization began in the 1980s. The global industrialization process of amorphous alloy materials has only been around for about 60 years, so amorphous alloy strips have broad technological and application prospects in the future. Compared with traditional materials such as silicon steel, amorphous alloys have lower coercivity, higher magnetic permeability, and higher electrical resistivity, making them easier to magnetize and demagnetize, significantly reducing electromagnetic conversion losses. They are preferred materials for energy transmission in the medium and low-frequency fields. Currently, amorphous alloy strips are mainly used in the global distribution transformer field. In addition to amorphous alloys, another major material used in distribution transformers is silicon steel. Compared with silicon steel, amorphous alloys have outstanding energy-saving and environmental protection characteristics, making them a ""manufacturing energy-saving, using energy-saving, and recycling energy-saving"" green material throughout their life cycle. With the help of the company's independently developed extreme manufacturing core technologies such as ""small flow rate molten precision continuous casting technology"" and ""extreme condensation control technology,"" the thickness of amorphous alloy strips produced by the company can reach 25±2µm, and the width specifications mainly include 142mm, 170mm, 213mm, etc., which can meet the product requirements of downstream customers. A single production line of the company can achieve continuous production of more than 20 tons of amorphous alloy strip products, maintaining the stability and consistency of the entire production process and finished products under extreme manufacturing conditions. Amorphous cores are products made from amorphous alloy strips through processes such as shearing, shaping, and heat treatment. They are the core components of amorphous transformers. Amorphous transformers are divided into dry-type transformers and oil-immersed transformers according to the cooling method, and flat wound cores and three-dimensional wound cores according to the winding structure. In order to promote the application of amorphous alloy strips, the company has gradually extended its business from being a material supplier of amorphous alloy strips to the downstream material product deep processing field and engaged in the production of amorphous cores. Currently, the company's amorphous core products are mainly flat wound cores used in oil-immersed distribution transformers and dry-type distribution transformers. Amorphous oil-immersed transformer flat wound cores are used to manufacture cores and windings immersed in insulating oil in amorphous transformers. For safety reasons, transformers manufactured with this type of core are mainly used in independent outdoor distribution sides. Amorphous dry-type transformer flat wound cores are used to manufacture cores and windings that are not immersed in insulating oil in amorphous transformers. These transformers have no oil immersion, which eliminates the problems of fire, explosion, pollution, etc. They can be widely used in comprehensive buildings or densely populated areas with high requirements for fire and explosion prevention, such as high-rise buildings, rail transportation, data centers, airports, and ports. In order to solve the industry pain points of high noise, poor surge short-circuit resistance, and easy fragmentation of amorphous alloy transformers, the company has successfully developed amorphous three-dimensional wound core products and systematic technology, allowing amorphous materials to be applied in distribution transformers in a safer and quieter manner. In 2019, the company cooperated with Tianjin Zhixin, a transformer manufacturer under the State Grid Corporation of China, to promote amorphous three-dimensional wound transformers.

In 2020, sample production was successfully achieved. This type of magnetic ring can be used in the high-frequency system of high-current heavy ion accelerators, breaking the monopoly and blockade of foreign companies in this field and solving the long-standing bottleneck problem in the accelerator field. (3) Magnetic powder segment: Magnetic powder is a granular magnetic material with spherical or quasi-spherical morphology produced by processes such as mechanical crushing and atomization spraying. Magnetic powder cores, which are made by insulating coating, pressing, annealing, impregnation, and spraying processes using magnetic powder particles, are one of the core components of electric energy conversion equipment. They are mainly used in new energy generation, new energy vehicles, consumer electronics, household appliances, and other fields. Currently, the company's magnetic powder segment mainly includes atomized powders, crushed powders, and magnetic powder cores produced using magnetic powders. Atomized powders are spherical or quasi-spherical granular magnetic materials obtained by atomizing metal melts using high-pressure gas atomization, water atomization, and other methods. The atomized powders currently produced by the company mainly include iron-silicon-aluminum powders, iron-silicon powders, iron-nickel powders, etc. Crushed powders are obtained by embrittling amorphous or nanocrystalline alloy strips at a certain temperature and then mechanically crushing them into powders that meet technical requirements. Currently, the crushed powders produced by the company mainly include amorphous crushed powders and nanocrystalline crushed powders. They are made by rapid cooling of metal melts using vacuum or non-vacuum smelting and rapid cooling by high-pressure gas or water impact. The powder particles are spherical or quasi-spherical, with good flowability and loose packing density. They are made from amorphous or nanocrystalline alloy strips through mechanical crushing. The optimized preparation process makes the crushed powders have no obvious sharp corners and are nearly spherical as a whole. They inherit the characteristics of high magnetic permeability, low loss, and high Curie temperature of amorphous and nanocrystalline alloys, making them more suitable for high-frequency and high-power circuit systems.

When the train is in regenerative braking, it generates electricity, causing the DC voltage to rise and posing an overvoltage threat to electrical equipment and power supply systems in the DC power supply system. The main function of the energy feedback device is to absorb or store this regenerated energy to achieve energy saving and avoid overvoltage in the DC power supply system, ensuring the normal operation of the power supply system and the safety of rail transportation systems. In the DC power supply system of subways, the energy generated by regenerative braking is inverted into AC power and fed back to the AC power grid for reuse by other electrical equipment. This stabilizes the DC traction network voltage within a safe range, ensuring normal train power supply and energy saving. When the train is in regenerative braking, the device switches in resistors to consume the regenerative braking energy, stabilizing the DC traction network voltage within a safe range, ensuring normal train power supply. When the regenerative braking of the train causes the DC voltage to rise, the device operates to store the regenerative braking energy in supercapacitors. When the train starts and causes the traction network DC voltage to drop, the device operates to release the energy stored in the supercapacitors back to the traction network for reuse by the train.

At the same time, the company has formulated relevant operating and maintenance procedures for equipment based on the requirements of the Medical Device Production Quality Management Specification. 3. Sales model*. The company's main product sales models include distribution, distribution, and direct sales. During the reporting period, the distribution model was the main sales model, and with the implementation and promotion of the ""two-ticket system"" and volume-based procurement policies, the proportion of distribution revenue has increased year by year. (1) Distribution model. Under the distribution model, the company sells its products to end customers through distributors. The company attaches great importance to deep cooperation and close collaboration with distributors, and has established a sound distributor system nationwide. Distributors with strong market promotion capabilities, rich experience in providing orthopedic medical device product services, and high-quality terminal channel resources are selected as partners. Under the distribution model, distributors are responsible for channel development, customer maintenance, and providing professional services such as preoperative consultation, logistics assistance, intraoperative guidance, cleaning and disinfection, and postoperative follow-up to end customers, maximizing the satisfaction of surgeons' surgical needs with the company's products. At the same time, the company's marketing team provides technical and professional support, assisting distributors in developing and maintaining end customers and providing related professional services. According to the company's sales strategy, based on different market regions, different types of products, and the financial and operational strength of distributors, the company's cooperation models with distributors are divided into buyout sales and consignment. Buyout sales: The company generally signs annual framework agreements with distributors, and distributors issue purchase orders to the company based on demand. Except for a few large-scale distributors with credit terms, the company generally delivers the goods after receiving the payment, and customers confirm receipt through signing or reconciliation, and the company recognizes revenue in the same month. Consignment: The company signs consignment agreements with distributors and sends consigned products to the distributor's warehouse. Under the consignment model, distributors sell downstream based on actual market demand, and after the products are sold to customers, distributors provide the company with actual product sales lists, and the company recognizes revenue. During the reporting period, the buyout sales model was the main distribution model. The company classifies distributors into primary distributors and platform distributors based on their business scale and coverage of downstream markets. The company signs annual framework agreements with distributors and authorizes them based on regions or terminal hospitals. Platform distributors: They have a large business scale, strong customer development and maintenance capabilities, diversified sales channels, and a wide coverage of downstream markets. They generally obtain authorization based on designated regions or terminal hospitals and sell directly to terminal hospitals within the authorized scope or through downstream distributors. Primary distributors: They have limited business scale but have certain customer development and maintenance capabilities, and relatively specialized sales channels. They generally obtain authorization based on terminal hospitals and sell directly to terminal hospitals. (2) Entry and exit of distributors. From 2017 to 2019, the number of distributors increased from 873 to 979 and then to 1,092, showing a continuous increase. On the one hand, the company continuously expands its product line and seeks cooperation with qualified distributors in various regions to expand the breadth of its marketing network. On the other hand, with the implementation of the ""two-ticket system"" and the continuous optimization of the marketing network, some distributors have exited. Holding a valid medical device operation qualification (Class II operation filing or Class III operation license) corresponding to the company's products and a business license is a necessary condition for distributors to sell the company's products. At the same time, the company comprehensively considers factors such as the business scale, financial strength, terminal coverage capabilities, warehousing capabilities, and business development capabilities of distributors to select suitable distributors. The company's sales department checks the validity of distributor qualifications every year. For distributors whose qualifications are about to expire, they are promptly contacted to provide updated qualifications. Sales personnel are responsible for the daily maintenance and management of distributors to prevent situations such as overdue payments, malicious stocking, and parallel trading. The company also provides business and technical training to distributors and dynamically assesses their performance, order execution, payment collection, and agreement fulfillment. The company requires distributors to strictly comply with the distribution agreement. If a cooperating distributor violates the agreement, the company will impose corresponding penalties and may cancel its distributor qualification depending on the situation. At the same time, the company conducts annual evaluations of distributors based on the dynamic assessment in the evaluation mechanism. For distributors who fail to meet the standards, the company may cancel their distributor qualifications according to the agreement. For the company's products, terminal hospitals generally conduct centralized procurement through provincial and municipal procurement platforms. The procurement platforms at all levels carry out related bidding procedures, comprehensive evaluations such as qualification review and product review, and finally determine the varieties and prices of products to be listed on the procurement platform (winning bid). After winning the bid, the terminal hospital selects the corresponding production enterprise or distributor to purchase the products based on actual needs, and the purchase price does not exceed the listed (winning bid) price. Under the distribution model, the company determines the sales price to distributors based on the product's winning bid price, while considering its own product positioning, pricing of similar products, and the average gross profit margin level in the industry. (3) Actual sales realization. The company's products are ultimately sold to terminal hospitals within the authorized distribution areas through distributors. Generally, the company and distributors agree on authorized hospitals and product lines in the distribution agreement. Due to the wide variety and specifications of orthopedic medical devices, distributors generally maintain a certain level of safety stock to meet the continuous surgical needs of terminal hospitals, taking into account factors such as the number of authorized terminal hospitals, the number of orthopedic surgeries in hospitals, etc. Distributors issue orders to the company based on the consumption of products by terminal hospitals, their own safety stock levels, the types of products they represent, and market development. (2) Distribution model. During the reporting period, in response to the ""two-ticket system"" policy, tender procurement policies, and the specific needs of terminal hospitals, the company sold its products to terminal hospitals through distributors in certain regions. Under the distribution model, the company generally sells its products to distributors with relevant qualifications, who then sell the products to terminal hospitals. Under the distribution model, the channel development, customer maintenance, and professional support services during the use of products are mainly provided by third-party service providers and the company's own marketing team. Under the distribution model, hospitals communicate their orthopedic consumable needs to distributors in advance. Distributors generally deliver the company's products to hospitals on the day of surgery, and after consumption, the distributors provide delivery consumption lists to the company. The company recognizes revenue after receiving the delivery consumption documents, and the pricing for the company's products sold to distributors is based on the terminal admission price minus the distribution costs. (3) Direct sales model. During the reporting period, the company had direct sales to terminal hospitals, but the proportion of revenue from direct sales was relatively low. At the same time, OEM products of the company's surgical instruments are generally sold to downstream customers through direct sales. Under the direct sales model, the channel development, customer maintenance, and professional support services during the use of products are mainly provided by third-party service providers and the company's own marketing team. Under the direct sales model, hospitals communicate their orthopedic consumable needs to the company or service providers in advance. The company or service providers generally deliver the company's products to hospitals on the day of surgery, and the company recognizes revenue after the products are consumed. The pricing of the company's products is based on the terminal admission price. 4. Research and development model*. The company has always adhered to independent research and development and innovation of technology and products, and actively maintained cooperation with medical institutions, clinical doctors, etc. (1) Project initiation. The market research is conducted by the company's research and development center, marketing department, and other relevant departments to summarize market demand, technical characteristics, product improvement, and innovation, etc. Project development suggestions are proposed and project demonstrations are conducted. For feasible project proposals after demonstration, project teams are established to clarify the key technical points of new products (product design ideas, raw materials, processing technology, etc.), formulate project budgets and schedule arrangements, and form project planning task documents, etc., to complete project initiation. (2) Design and development. The project leader organizes the project team to develop technical solutions, evaluate risks, determine research and development plans, and generate drawings and processes. During the design process, auxiliary means such as rapid prototyping samples, functional trial production verification of local parts of the product, finite element calculation analysis, etc., are used for product design optimization. Technical drawings that have been preliminarily verified are handed over to the trial production unit for product trial production. After the samples are processed by the trial production unit, the project team, together with the laboratory, conducts structural and functional verification of the product. After the verification is passed, technical documents such as product confirmation plans and technical conclusions of product design verification during the research and development process are proposed based on the technical characteristics, functional requirements, and appearance design proposed in the design plan. These documents are reviewed by the research and development management team. (3) Registration and inspection. After the review is passed, the project team prepares the technical requirements document for the medical device product to be registered (mainly including performance indicators and inspection methods, etc.), and submits it to a medical testing institution recognized by the National Medical Products Administration for registration inspection along with the registered inspection samples. (4) Clinical evaluation. The project team, together with relevant departments of the company, formulates clinical plans, selects and confirms control products, confirms clinical bases, and prepares clinical samples. After obtaining the product registration inspection report, the clinical specialist contacts the confirmed clinical base and main researchers, holds an ethics meeting, initiates clinical trials, and conducts follow-up and verification during the clinical trial process. For products included in the ""List of Medical Devices Exempted from Clinical Trials"" or evaluated based on clinical trial and usage data of the same type of medical devices, the company conducts comparative tests with the same type of products according to the requirements of the ""Technical Guidelines for Clinical Evaluation of Medical Devices."" After the tests, relevant clinical evaluation materials are compiled and submitted to the competent authority. (5) Registration application. After the completion of clinical evaluation, the registration department prepares registration materials and submits them to the research and development management team for review. After the review, the materials are submitted to the evaluation center of the National Medical Products Administration, and the registration materials are supplemented according to the requirements of the evaluation center. 5. The reasons for adopting the current operating model and the key factors affecting the operating model. The company adopts the current operating model mainly based on factors such as industry regulatory laws and regulations, national industrial policies, industry competition patterns, the development level of the industry upstream and downstream, and the market operating environment. At the same time, it is determined based on the company's own development strategy, resource elements, and technological strength. (Three) The evolution of the main business, main products, and main operating models since its establishment. 1. Evolution of the main business. Since its establishment, the company has focused on the research, development, production, and sales of orthopedic medical devices, and the main business has not undergone significant changes. 2. Evolution of main products. In 2005, when the company was established, the product layout mainly focused on spine and trauma orthopedic implant medical devices, targeting the domestic mid-to-high-end market, and the product quality was benchmarked against international advanced levels. In the first year of its establishment, the company's spine posterior fixation system (SINO) obtained product registration certificates and became one of the first domestic spine fixation systems. In 2006, the company's spine products included interbody fusion devices (PEEK), filling the gap in the domestic market. In the same year, the company's trauma products, such as metal locking bone plate systems, obtained product registration certificates, becoming one of the first domestic products of the same kind.
