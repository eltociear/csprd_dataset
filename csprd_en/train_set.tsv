256	Bora Network Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft for Review)	New Generation Information Technology	"Bora Network is a provider of enterprise big data services. Based on its independently developed E2C (E-service to Company) digital business big data cloud platform, Bora Network offers technical development services and big data application services to enterprise clients through a business model of ""big data + technology products + application services."" These services mainly include data analysis consulting, data collection and management, value-added operation services, as well as industry solutions for big data in digital marketing, e-commerce, and customer relationship management. Bora Network helps physical enterprises build big data assets and intelligent application platforms, promoting the gradual realization of digital transformation and upgrading driven by data. According to the national standard GB/T35274-2017 ""Information Security Technology Big Data Service Security Capability Requirements,"" big data application providers can play three roles in the industrial chain: data, technology, and service. Big data application providers should use technologies such as machine learning and data mining to help big data users carry out various tasks, such as precision marketing. The business system of ""big data + technology products + application services"" constructed by the company falls within the definition of ""service components"" in the scope of ""big data application services"" and big data platforms. The company's big data comes from the accumulation and precipitation of data resources during the provision of numerous digital marketing, e-commerce, and membership management services to various physical enterprises since its establishment in 2006. Through data collection and integration of various digital media and marketing channels (including information mining based on social media, comprehensive network monitoring and SEM mining, online and offline interactive activities, EDM, website browsing, mobile app applications, CRM, sales outlets, user membership organizations, digital media advertising, industry data, etc.), the company has built a precise audience database, as well as user databases in major vertical industries such as automobiles, fast-moving consumer goods, 3C electronics, e-commerce, and retail. The enterprise big data services provided by the company are mainly divided into two categories: technical development services and big data application services, based on the type of service. According to the industry attributes and business needs of enterprise clients, the company customizes the development of various big data application systems and related technology application tools to help enterprises acquire, analyze, and manage data resources, as well as explore and utilize data value, meeting the application needs of enterprises in management decision-making, market communication, product sales, customer service, and other aspects. The technical development content mainly includes the following types: (1) collection, management, and analysis systems for various commercial data of enterprises; (2) enterprise data asset management platforms for integrating and managing various scattered data sources within and outside the enterprise (such as sales, customer service, production and operation, etc.) and visual analysis, etc.; (3) various interactive customer acquisition components, precision delivery platforms, and potential customer mining systems for marketing application scenarios; (4) mall management systems, channel management systems, and data analysis systems for e-commerce application scenarios; (5) data management and operation platforms for members (or fans) in customer relationship management application scenarios; (6) smart community application platforms, smart park platforms, AI recognition systems, intelligent data analysis, etc. for intelligent community application scenarios; (7) operation management and data analysis systems for specific industries such as government and finance. In the long-term process of serving enterprise clients, the company has developed and accumulated different types of big data application components. These components adopt unified technical development rules (development frameworks, data and interface specifications, etc.) and can be customized and assembled according to customer functional requirements, thereby improving development efficiency and reducing development costs. Big data application services: Based on the technical products of the E2C big data cloud platform and the application component library, the company provides enterprise clients with application solutions for big data in various business scenarios, mainly divided into three types: big data marketing and operation, digital media delivery, and e-commerce and others. (1) Big data marketing and operation: Based on the company's E2C big data platform and various marketing technology product components, it provides enterprises with data collection, monitoring, and analysis services for various commercial data; potential customer data mining and precise customer acquisition; hosting operation, data integration, and management services for enterprise self-media; e-commerce marketing, e-commerce data analysis, and operation optimization; enterprise member or fan data management and operation; ultimately realizing the construction of enterprise data asset systems (aggregation, management, analysis, and value mining of various enterprise data sources). The main service process and content are shown in the table below: [Table](2) Digital media delivery: Before delivery, based on insights into the basic attributes of the target audience and past experience in media delivery, the company analyzes and refines the characteristics of the target audience and matches them accurately with multidimensional user data labels (such as age, geographic location, interests, consumption habits, social relationships, etc.) of the enterprise or digital media. This is done to develop targeted delivery plans for enterprise clients (delivery channels, target audience, delivery time, delivery content and format, delivery price, etc.) to achieve precise delivery. During delivery, real-time monitoring and analysis of feedback on delivery effectiveness data are conducted to continuously optimize user data labels and delivery strategies. After delivery, timely evaluation of the value of delivery plans, delivery effectiveness, and delivery channels is carried out to form multidimensional analysis reports to provide data optimization support for the next delivery. Accumulating and expanding precise user data assets converted through media delivery, implementing classification management, enriching user data labels, associating with enterprise customer relationship management systems, and stimulating more data value-added effects. The company's current digital media delivery mainly focuses on social media such as WeChat Moments and Toutiao. (3) E-commerce and others: The company's current e-commerce operation services usually adopt a buyout sales model, where the company purchases goods from supply companies and sells them to end customers through online e-commerce platforms such as JD.com. During the process of selling goods through e-commerce channels, the company provides sales lead mining, precision marketing, e-commerce operation and optimization, and other supporting technical and marketing services for the goods. Other businesses mainly involve the company acting as an agent for selling Oracle database products from Oracle Corporation. By collecting and analyzing key data such as the source of consumers on e-commerce platforms, preferences for browsing products, consumption behavior paths, product evaluations, and feedback, the issuer can develop and adjust marketing channels and strategies, optimize the listing of products, sorting and display effects, inventory stocking quantities, logistics and distribution, and other e-commerce operation plans to improve user conversion rates, promote actual sales, reduce warehousing and logistics costs, and minimize product losses. The correlation between the two business segments of big data application services and technical development services is a mutually beneficial and organic relationship. Faced with the challenge of effectively handling internet users and information data and the lack of professional technical talents and application experience in enterprises, a single technical product or a traditional service approach detached from technology can no longer meet the increasing and deepening demands for big data applications in enterprises. Instead, it is necessary to organically combine technology with application services, using product technology to solve data processing issues and applying technology to various business processes of enterprises through services. This is the only way to truly unleash the value of technology in applications. The two are complementary. Considering the need to reduce internal communication costs and improve business operation efficiency, customers require service providers with integrated service capabilities. These service providers should not only develop technical systems and platforms but also provide subsequent operation and big data application services for these platforms. The company has a background in internet and big data technology and has accumulated rich experience in application services through long-term service to numerous large enterprise clients. It can well meet the integrated service needs of customers for ""technical development + application services."" An example of the company's integrated ""technical development + application services"" is the project contract for the construction and operation of the ""Changan Passenger Car Dealer Online Cloud Store System"" obtained through bidding with Changan Automobile. In terms of technical development services, the company designed and developed the ""dealer online cloud store system"" for Changan Automobile. Based on Changan Automobile's official service account, the company built its own online e-commerce matrix system. This system is similar to the Tmall Mall model. It uses Changan Automobile's online cloud store system as a unified e-commerce operation platform and connects all WeChat service accounts of more than 700 dealers nationwide. Each dealer can open their own store on this platform and independently manage and configure their store. The dealer's sales consultant acts as the shop assistant (receiving and responding to user inquiries anytime, anywhere). This system serves as the main entry point for e-commerce traffic. It analyzes mobile terminal data of visiting users and automatically diverts them to the online stores of dealers in their geographical areas. Users can place orders, pay deposits, submit feedback, and promote O2O actual sales through QR codes. Changan Automobile can also manage all dealer stores through this system. The potential customer and member data of all dealers' stores will be aggregated in the manufacturer's big data center, solving the problem of scattered data in the hands of dealers in the past. Through unified data collection and management, a good foundation is laid for improving sales conversion rates, strengthening after-sales management, and stimulating member value. In addition, Changan Automobile can concentrate market expenses previously distributed to various dealers on a unified e-commerce traffic entry platform, effectively improving marketing effectiveness. The company used its independently developed program component library to assemble and develop the dealer cloud store platform for the client in a short period. This platform has a series of functions such as product display, online car ordering, mall management, shop assistant management, terminal activity management, and data management, effectively meeting the client's e-commerce and channel management functional requirements. In terms of big data application services, the company provided Changan Automobile with subsequent big data application service solutions on the system platform generated from the above-mentioned technical development. The company not only quickly deployed and applied the system platform to Changan Automobile and its more than 1,600 dealers nationwide but also provided continuous big data marketing and operation services for the e-commerce platform. This includes customer acquisition through various precision marketing methods, attracting the attention and participation of target users, as well as continuous application services such as user data management, user value analysis, user activity organization, targeted and precise promotional information push, customer service, and relationship management. These services help maintain the activity of users entering the platform and gradually form stickiness, aggregate and accumulate the core customer group of the manufacturer, continuously generate value-added effects, drive and influence the attention and participation of other potential customers, and continuously expand the cycle of user data resources. The organic combination of the above-mentioned technical development and application services not only solves the technical problems faced by Changan Automobile due to the lack of talent and experience but also helps the client effectively build an online sales user data asset and application system through subsequent application services. The integrated service ensures that the big data technology system can truly unleash its application value, which has been recognized by Changan Automobile."

Finally, the intelligent agricultural management system completes the equipment and data loop, assisted by artificial intelligence for decision-making, providing a comprehensive solution for smart agriculture. 2. Overview of the company's main products and services. Currently, the company's main products and services include the research and development, manufacturing, and sales of agricultural drones, agricultural unmanned vehicles, agricultural machine autopilots, agricultural IoT devices, and other smart agricultural equipment, as well as the provision of related technical services. (1) Smart agricultural equipment. Through continuous iteration, the company's agricultural drones have greatly improved their operational effectiveness, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. The level of intelligence and diversity of application scenarios have gradually improved, and the user threshold continues to decrease. Currently, the company's agricultural drones integrate precision spraying, intelligent seeding, and field mapping, and can perform automated precision operations in various complex terrains. They provide efficient, flexible, green, and cost-effective unmanned production solutions for agricultural workers, improve production efficiency, save agricultural resources, and solve pain points such as labor shortages, excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, high maintenance costs of agricultural machinery, and limited operational scenarios. They have become one of the main execution devices in smart agricultural production. (2) Smart agricultural management system. The XAG Technology XSAS smart agricultural system is a digital production management platform developed for farm managers. Its main functions include farmland plot information management, meteorological and agricultural analysis, agricultural decision-making and planning, and online management of agricultural machinery and supplies. The system helps managers achieve informationization and intelligence in agricultural operations, agronomy, agricultural machinery, and agricultural supplies management, solving the problems of traditional farm management relying on manual decision-making and experience judgment, reducing production risks, and improving comprehensive benefits. The smart agricultural equipment developed by the company can be integrated into the XSAS smart agricultural system, allowing users to remotely supervise and control the equipment and monitor the progress of operations through the system. In addition, the crop growth and environmental data collected by remote sensing drones and IoT devices are also imported into the system in real time. By using the company's agricultural artificial intelligence technology and corresponding crop growth models, the system provides users with scientific production decision support, ultimately achieving high-quality, low-cost, and large-scale farm management. (3) Technical services. The company's technical services mainly include paid after-sales maintenance and support services provided to end users. 3. Application scenarios and operational advantages of the company's main products. (1) Agricultural drones are widely used in agricultural operations. At present, agricultural drones are mainly used for sowing, fertilizing, and pesticide spraying in agricultural operations. They are widely applicable to various grain crops and cash crops. Different crops have different growth characteristics, resulting in varying demands for agricultural drones. The table below shows the planting area (in hectares) and the frequency of drone operations during the growth cycle for different crops. The drones are used for tasks such as sowing, fertilizing, and pesticide spraying to prevent diseases and pests and control weed growth. The table also shows the number of times these tasks are performed. In addition to the listed crops, agricultural drones are also widely used in crops such as potatoes, sunflowers, rapeseed, soybeans, peanuts, as well as orchards and forests. Apart from these functions, agricultural drones equipped with remote sensing modules can also replace manual field inspections. They can monitor crop growth indicators, biomass, plant height, and identify diseases, pests, and weeds in specific areas. This information can assist in making informed decisions for subsequent operations. (2) Agricultural drones are the direction for intelligent and efficient post-planting management. Currently, post-planting management in Chinese agriculture mainly relies on manual labor or semi-mechanized equipment, which is labor-intensive and may result in excessive use and low efficiency of pesticides and fertilizers, leading to waste of agricultural resources and potential ecological pollution. Compared to traditional methods, the application of agricultural drones in post-planting management has the following advantages: - High level of intelligence: Agricultural drones can autonomously plan flight routes and perform tasks such as sowing, fertilizing, and pesticide spraying in various terrains, achieving labor reduction and unmanned operations. - Precision and efficiency: Agricultural drones can fly along precise routes, ensuring accurate and efficient operations without over-spraying or missing spots. They can customize crop protection based on prescription maps, significantly improving pesticide utilization and reducing environmental pollution, as well as reducing the cost of pest control. - Water-saving and high-efficiency: Agricultural drones use centrifugal atomization nozzles, which can spray high-concentration liquid without the need for high dilution ratios, saving water resources. They have high operational efficiency and excellent pesticide application effects. The mainstream agricultural drones can cover an area of about 200-300 acres per hour, which is dozens of times higher than manual spraying. The use of high-precision flow control and ultra-low volume atomization technology allows the drones to produce extremely fine particles, and the downward airflow generated by the propellers can penetrate the vegetation, promoting the absorption of pesticides by plants and achieving better spraying effects. - Safety and crop protection: Agricultural drones can fly autonomously, avoiding direct exposure of operators to chemical agents during spraying operations, thus improving safety. They can also reduce crop damage compared to ground machinery such as tractors, which may cause soil compaction and crop damage. In addition to manual or semi-mechanized operations, some countries also use fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters for large-scale post-planting management. Compared to large manned agricultural aircraft, agricultural drones have advantages such as high maneuverability, flexibility, ease of operation, precise operations, and low purchase and maintenance costs, making them more suitable for small-scale family farming in China. (3) Smart agricultural solutions empower agriculture in specific forms. Technological empowerment of agriculture is an effective measure to improve the productivity of agricultural inputs, address the contradiction between current and future grain demand and relatively insufficient resource endowment, and promote the transformation of agriculture from extensive and inefficient to ecological, green, and efficient. In China's agricultural production, the mechanization rate of tillage activities has reached 80%, with mainly manned tractors being used, which rely on human driving and may cause problems such as curved furrows and low leveling, directly affecting crop yield and quality. In the company's smart agricultural solutions, remote sensing drones are first used to perform high-precision remote sensing mapping of farmland, and the terrain analysis is carried out using artificial intelligence technology. The agricultural machine autopilot uses the results of terrain analysis to autonomously plan land preparation routes and perform automated land preparation work in conjunction with tractors. The application of agricultural technology products can effectively ensure land leveling, optimize the spatial layout of farmland, solve problems such as uneven crop planting, uneven light distribution, and uneven pesticide spraying, and also reduce the difficulty of water management for crops such as rice. In China's agricultural production, the mechanization rate of planting activities is close to 60%. Most of the work has been replaced by seeders instead of manual seeding. However, decisions regarding seeding timing still rely on human experience. In terraced fields in mountainous and hilly areas, seeders cannot be efficiently used due to complex terrain. The agricultural IoT devices developed by the company effectively improve the level of field information by assisting farmers in judging the timing of sowing through soil and climate monitoring. The agricultural machine autopilot, when used in conjunction with seeders, can improve the accuracy and automation of seeding operations. The agricultural drones can perform aerial seeding of crops such as rice and rapeseed, to some extent, overcoming the limitations of terrain. The two devices, aerial and ground-based, complement each other and can meet the automation requirements of various scenarios. After sowing, the use of remote sensing drones for field inspections can conduct a comprehensive survey of emergence rates and provide precise guidance for replanting based on the survey results. This solves the problems of low efficiency, low accuracy, and labor consumption in field inspections, and effectively improves crop yield and farmers' planting benefits. Post-planting management includes disease and pest control, weed management, fertilization and irrigation, crop growth monitoring, environmental and meteorological monitoring, and other necessary measures to maintain the healthy growth of crops. Currently, the mechanization rate of post-planting management in China is relatively low, and most of the work is still mainly done manually, resulting in low efficiency, high costs, and difficulties in ensuring operational accuracy. Agricultural drones, unmanned vehicles, and other agricultural unmanned devices, as the execution devices in the company's smart agricultural solutions, can accurately apply pesticides and fertilizers in an automated manner, improving operational efficiency and reducing the use of agricultural chemicals while achieving higher efficiency. This solves the problems of ecological damage caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers in the past and significantly saves agricultural resources, contributing to the sustainable development of agriculture. At the same time, the smart agricultural management system provides auxiliary decision-making for the work of agricultural unmanned devices, achieving machine-assisted decision-making based on scientific knowledge. On the one hand, the smart agricultural management system can provide pest and disease warnings based on meteorological and environmental data collected by agricultural IoT devices, guiding agricultural unmanned devices to perform crop pest control work in advance. On the other hand, the smart agricultural management system can analyze the results of field inspections conducted by remote sensing drones, intelligently identify weed areas, generate prescription maps for precise spraying by agricultural drones, and monitor crop growth to develop suitable pesticide and fertilizer application plans for different growth stages of crops. In China, the mechanization rate of crop harvesting has reached 55%, and the main agricultural machinery used is manned harvesters. There is still significant room for improvement in the mechanization rate of harvesting operations. The combination of agricultural machine autopilots and manned harvesters can reduce labor costs and improve harvesting efficiency for farmers. At the same time, remote sensing drones have the ability to estimate crop yields and predict harvests with an accuracy rate of over 95%, helping farmers plan for harvesting, storage, processing, and sales.

85	Beijing Tiantech Heda Semiconductor Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft)	'通用' translates to 'universal' or 'general' in English.	"The company's main products are silicon carbide wafers, other silicon carbide products, and silicon carbide single crystal growth furnaces. Among them, silicon carbide wafers are the core product of the company, and other silicon carbide products include silicon carbide seed crystals and silicon carbide crystals. As a substrate material, after epitaxial growth, device manufacturing, and packaging testing, it is made into HEMT and other microwave RF devices, suitable for high-frequency, high-temperature, and other working environments, mainly used in 5G communication, satellite, radar, and other fields. The ""seed"" wafers with the same crystal structure as the required silicon carbide single crystal are used for growing silicon carbide crystals. They can be used for processing silicon carbide wafers, equipment research and development, and testing. Among them, semi-insulating silicon carbide crystals can be used to make moissanite gemstones and synthetic moissanite jewelry. Used for the growth and preparation of conductive and semi-insulating silicon carbide crystals. (1) Silicon carbide wafers. Silicon carbide wafers are single crystal thin slices formed by processing silicon carbide crystals through cutting, grinding, polishing, cleaning, and other processes. Silicon carbide wafers, as semiconductor substrate materials, can be made into silicon carbide-based power devices and microwave RF devices through epitaxial growth and device manufacturing. They are important basic materials for the development of the third-generation semiconductor industry. According to different resistivity, silicon carbide wafers can be divided into conductive and semi-insulating types. Among them, conductive silicon carbide wafers are mainly used to manufacture high-temperature and high-pressure power devices, with a large market size; semi-insulating silicon carbide substrates are mainly used in the field of microwave RF devices. With the accelerated construction of 5G communication networks, the market demand has increased significantly. The larger the size of the wafer, the greater the difficulty in growing and processing the corresponding crystal, and the higher the manufacturing efficiency and lower unit cost of downstream devices. Currently, international silicon carbide wafer manufacturers mainly provide 4-inch to 6-inch silicon carbide wafers. Leading international companies such as CREE and II-VI have begun to invest in the construction of 8-inch silicon carbide wafer production lines. The company was the first in China to successfully develop 6-inch silicon carbide wafers. During the reporting period, the company's silicon carbide wafer products were mainly 4 inches, gradually transitioning to 6 inches, and started 8-inch wafer research and development work in January 2020. (2) Other silicon carbide products. Other silicon carbide products include silicon carbide crystals and silicon carbide seed crystals. Among them, seed crystals are ""seeds"" for growing crystals and are mainly used to grow silicon carbide crystals in single crystal growth furnaces. Crystals are mainly processed into silicon carbide wafers and can also be used to make moissanite jewelry or be used by equipment manufacturers for testing cutting equipment, etc. Seed crystals are high-quality silicon carbide wafers used for the growth of silicon carbide crystals. Compared with general silicon carbide wafers, seed crystals have higher requirements for crystal quality, larger size, and thickness, and their sales prices are relatively high. During the reporting period, the seed crystals produced by the company were mainly used to meet its own production needs, with fewer sales to the outside. Silicon carbide crystals are intermediate products for producing silicon carbide wafers. The silicon carbide crystals produced by the company are mainly used for external sales after being processed into silicon carbide wafers. According to different resistivity, the company's silicon carbide crystals can be divided into conductive and semi-insulating types. Among them, high-quality semi-insulating silicon carbide crystals are almost colorless and have hardness, brightness, fire color, and other indicators that are close to or even exceed diamonds. They can be used as gemstone crystals to make moissanite and other jewelry and enter the consumer goods market. In recent years, with the decline in natural diamond mining and the increasing demand for environmental protection, moissanite has gradually emerged as an alternative high-quality jewelry, and its market size has gradually increased globally. The parameters required for gemstone crystals processed into moissanite have certain differences from semiconductor silicon carbide crystals. The semiconductor industry pays more attention to the electrical properties and microstructure of crystals such as microtube density and resistivity, while the silicon carbide crystals used in the gemstone industry pay more attention to appearance indicators such as purity and color. The preparation process is relatively easier, but at the same time, the two have high similarities in process technology such as crystal growth, diameter expansion, polymorphism, and high purity control. With deep technical reserves and process accumulation in the field of silicon carbide crystal growth, the company's gemstone crystal growth technology has quickly matured, and it can provide high-quality gemstone crystals on a large scale. In addition to having higher economic benefits, the production of gemstone crystals by the company also has a process verification and improvement effect on the growth of semi-insulating silicon carbide crystals. During the reporting period, the other silicon carbide crystals sold by the company were mainly used for research conducted by scientific research institutes and for testing and improving crystal cutting equipment by equipment manufacturers. Silicon carbide, as the most industrialized basic material in the third-generation semiconductor, has always been one of the key research objects of equipment manufacturing companies and major scientific research institutes. During the reporting period, the company sold a small amount of unground and unpolished silicon carbide cutting slices to be used for the research and development and testing of silicon carbide wafer processing equipment by grinding and polishing equipment manufacturers, as well as for the research work on silicon carbide materials by domestic and foreign scientific research institutes. (3) Silicon carbide single crystal growth furnace. The silicon carbide single crystal growth furnace is the production equipment for silicon carbide crystals and is the basis for the company to supply high-quality silicon carbide wafers on a large scale. In the long-term research and development and production process of silicon carbide crystals, the company has continuously explored and accumulated crystal growth processes, continuously improved and upgraded the mechanical structure and control system of single crystal growth furnaces, and mastered core technologies such as high-temperature precise control and vacuum environment control to stably grow high-quality silicon carbide crystals. With the increasing market demand for third-generation semiconductor materials, more and more industrial enterprises and scientific research institutes have entered the field of silicon carbide substrate materials."

(2) Resource utilization refers to activities that use hazardous waste as raw materials to produce products that meet relevant standards on the basis of harmless treatment processes. Resource products include organic solvents, inorganic salts, base oils, heavy metals, and packaging containers. The company sells these resource products externally, which not only enhances the company's profitability but also practices the concept of a circular economy, achieving harmonious unity of economic benefits, environmental benefits, and social benefits. It can both ""turn harm into profit"" and ""turn waste into treasure,"" and is an important way to achieve the ""peak carbon"" and ""carbon neutrality"" strategies. For example, in the case of waste organic solvents, the industry generally uses incineration for disposal, which increases greenhouse gas emissions. The company relies on independently developed waste organic solvent resource utilization technology to produce high-quality solvent products using waste organic solvents, achieving the substitution of raw materials and reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. With the advantage of the company's multi-process synergy model, the waste gas generated during the utilization of waste organic solvents is disposed of by incineration, and the overall treatment efficiency can reach 99.9%, far exceeding the industry average. This has a significant ""carbon emission reduction"" effect in terms of substituting petrochemical products and avoiding incineration disposal. Waste organic solutions are used to produce amino paint diluents."	The translation of '综合' in English is 'comprehensive' or 'synthesis'.	4.

It consists of motor controller/generator controller. The motor controller for pure electric vehicles converts DC power to AC power and controls the motor's speed through frequency modulation. The company's developed motor controllers include DC brushless motor controllers and permanent magnet synchronous motor controllers, covering a power range of 15 kW to 60 kW. In hybrid vehicles, except for the BSG motor used in the P0 structure and the ISG motor used in the P1 structure, the other motor controllers are the same as those used in pure electric vehicles, generally permanent magnet synchronous motor controllers. The hybrid generator controller controls the conversion of engine kinetic energy into electrical energy, working similarly to the motor controller.The electric vehicle's whole vehicle controller has functions such as high-voltage energy management and distribution, charging status monitoring, network management and monitoring, vehicle fault diagnosis, and brake energy recovery. The hybrid vehicle's whole vehicle controller has similar functions to the pure electric vehicle's whole vehicle controller, with additional modules such as EMS, GCU, and TCU that are not involved in pure electric vehicles.

The company's products have expanded to include various engine management systems for twin-cylinder, three-cylinder, and four-cylinder engines. The company has mastered technologies such as EGR for reducing combustion temperature, efficient and energy-saving technologies like VVT, DVVT, turbocharging, intercooling, and direct fuel injection, as well as electronic throttle control technology. By the end of 2019, over a million vehicles have used the company's electronic control systems. The company's automotive EMS is mainly used in N1 models and crossover passenger cars, with smaller sales in sedans, SUVs, and MPVs. High-end models mainly use direct fuel injection engines, which pose higher technical challenges, while most low- to mid-range models use intake manifold injection engines. High-end models mainly use automatic transmissions, which require control through TCU and communication with EMS during calibration, while some low- to mid-range models use automatic transmissions. Basic models use manual transmissions and do not require TCU. In the China VI emission stage, electronic throttle EMS is used, while in the China V emission stage, mechanical throttle EMS is mainly used. Due to the differences in vehicle configurations, sedans, SUVs, and MPVs face greater challenges in market entry compared to crossover passenger cars.For dual-fuel engine management systems in CNG and gasoline vehicles, the industry generally adds CNG systems to existing gasoline vehicles, simulating CNG injection and ignition signals as those of gasoline engines, while adding a simulator to shield the OBD diagnostic function of the original gasoline engine. The company has developed different control strategies and OBD diagnostic strategies for gasoline and CNG based on the underlying control logic, as well as different MAP calibrations for the two fuels, overcoming the problem of OBD diagnostics not working properly in retrofit systems. Since the implementation of the ""Technical Conditions for the Safety of Motor Vehicle Operation"" on January 1, 2018, users are prohibited from modifying and installing fuel tanks or changing fuel types. Dual-fuel vehicles must be used in the state announced, and OBD diagnostics are a legally required test item. Adding CNG systems to existing gasoline vehicles becomes an illegal solution, which opens up application space for the company's dual-fuel engine management systems.For motorcycle engine management systems, considering the small displacement and high speed characteristics of motorcycle engines, the company uses a low-cost automotive engine speed density model to calculate intake MAP for closed-loop fuel control, replacing traditional carburetors and avoiding the venturi effect. The company uses a full operating condition ignition angle MAP control instead of a single control by a traditional ignition system, achieving control functions such as startup control, idle speed closed-loop control, acceleration/deceleration transition control, OBD diagnostics, closed-loop fuel self-learning, oxygen sensor heating control, exhaust temperature model control, cooling fan control, etc. This system is suitable for single-cylinder/dual-cylinder motorcycle engines with displacements ranging from 50cc to 800cc and can be used in ATV, tricycles, scooters, mopeds, and other vehicle models.The power electronic control system for pure electric vehicles includes the motor control unit (MCU), which is responsible for transferring energy between the power source and the motor. It consists of an inverter and a controller. The inverter converts DC power output from the battery into three-phase AC power to provide energy to the vehicle. The controller receives feedback signals such as motor speed and adjusts the inverter's frequency to achieve deceleration or acceleration during braking or acceleration. The company's developed electric vehicle motor controllers include DC brushless motor controllers and permanent magnet synchronous motor controllers, covering a power range of 15 kW to 60 kW. The vehicle control unit (VCU) is the core component of the electric vehicle's whole vehicle electronic control system. Its main functions include torque control, brake energy optimization control, overall energy management, charging management, communication and network management, fault diagnosis and handling, and vehicle status monitoring. The VCU is responsible for managing and coordinating other controllers such as TCU, motor controllers, battery management systems, and DC/DC controllers. The company's developed VCU has been applied in models such as Jiangnan Alto TT, Xinyuan electric logistics vehicles, Lifan electric vehicles, and Taixin electric vehicles.The power electronic control system for hybrid vehicles combines battery-powered electric drive with an internal combustion engine. Hybrid vehicles utilize the excellent variable operating condition characteristics of electric motors to achieve mode shifting, keeping the engine operating in the optimal performance range to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Hybrid vehicles can be classified into parallel hybrid structures (including P0, P1, P2, P2.5, P3, P4 structures, and composite structures with multiple motors such as P0+P4), series hybrid structures (range-extended electric vehicles), and power split hybrid structures (Ps structure), each involving different power electronic control systems. The company provides EMS, VCU, MCU, and GCU (used in range-extended electric vehicles) products in the hybrid vehicle electronic control system. As of June 30, 2020, only EMS products have been sold. In addition to the three major series of electronic control system products, the company also provides calibration technology development services during the software matching process for specific vehicle models. The electronic control system is a carrier that combines software and data, and data is embedded in the software program. Without data, the electronic control system program cannot run, and calibration is the process of obtaining data. The company may charge customers for calibration services depending on the situation, thereby generating revenue from technology development services."

Construction of core technology platforms: After more than ten years of accumulation and development, the issuer has established a complete research and development system covering drug discovery and mechanism research, preclinical development, pharmaceutical research, translational scientific research, global clinical trials, regulations, and registration declaration. Based on this complete and efficient research and development system, combined with years of clinical drug development practice, the issuer has built three core technology platforms and developed multiple novel candidate drugs, which are being systematically advanced to the clinical stage.    (1) The Targeted Immune and Modulation Normalization (TIMN) technology platform is a collective research and development platform independently developed by the issuer, integrating in vitro and in vivo models and translational scientific research. It focuses on targeted regulation of tumor immune microenvironment and treatment of autoimmune diseases. Based on this technology platform, the issuer has discovered that APL-1202 can enhance immune cell function in the tumor immune microenvironment and enhance the efficacy of PD-1 monoclonal antibodies. Based on these research results, the issuer submitted an application for a Phase I/II clinical trial of APL-1202 in combination with trastuzumab to the US FDA in May 2021 for the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). In addition, based on the TIMN technology platform and the mechanism of neurotransmitter-regulated immune function, the issuer has discovered a compound, APL-1401, which has immunosuppressive activity and is expected to enter clinical trials as a new drug with a completely new mechanism of action in the field of autoimmune diseases. By modifying the specific groups of the original drugs and combining them with controlled-release formulations, the issuer obtains new drug products with superior efficacy, safety, and administration routes. The issuer has developed APL-1501, APL-1901, and other investigational products based on this technology platform. Among them, APL-1501 was approved for Phase I clinical trials in Australia in October 2020 and is planned for further development in the treatment of urogenital system tumors and drug-resistant urinary tract infections.   (3) The Fragment-Based Assembling & Selectively Targeting Chimeras (FASTac) technology platform is based on the targeted protein degradation technology.

As of the signing date of this prospectus, the issuer is conducting research and development and registration work for nine products, of which three studies of two products are in Phase III or critical clinical trial stages. APL-1202 is the world's first oral, reversible type II methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) inhibitor to enter critical/Phase III clinical trials. It is also the first oral targeted treatment drug for NMIBC to enter critical/Phase III clinical trials internationally, filling a market gap in this treatment field. The APL-1202 project received support from the National ""Twelfth Five-Year"" and ""Thirteenth Five-Year"" Major New Drug Creation Science and Technology Major Projects in 2015 and 2018, respectively. The Phase II clinical trial results of APL-1202 as a monotherapy for the second-line treatment of recurrent high-risk NMIBC showed that its efficacy was significantly better than the standard treatment of bladder chemotherapy infusion based on historical research data. At the same time, compared with bladder infusion, the oral administration of APL-1202 can greatly reduce the pain during the treatment process and has obvious advantages in patient compliance. The indications for APL-1202 in the field of NMIBC have entered critical or Phase III clinical trials in China: (1) combination chemotherapy infusion for the second-line treatment of recurrent intermediate-high-risk NMIBC; (2) monotherapy for the first-line treatment of untreated intermediate-risk NMIBC. The indication for APL-1202 in combination with chemotherapy infusion for the second-line treatment of recurrent intermediate-high-risk NMIBC is expected to be submitted for marketing approval to the National Medical Products Administration in 2022. In the field of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), the issuer submitted an application for a Phase I/II clinical trial of APL-1202 in combination with trastuzumab to the US FDA in May 2021 for the treatment of MIBC. APL-1702 is a photodynamic therapy medical device combination product that the issuer has advanced to an international multicenter Phase III clinical trial based on the global patent rights authorized by Photocure.

Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft for Review)	'通用' translates to 'universal' or 'general' in English.	"1. Solid Waste Pollution Barrier and Remediation Business: The company is engaged in the construction of solid waste pollution barrier and remediation systems. This involves the prevention and remediation of pollution in landfill or storage sites for various types of solid waste, including municipal solid waste, industrial solid waste, incineration fly ash, and hazardous waste. The company is one of the early enterprises in the industry to engage in this business and has implemented a large number of projects. It can provide customers with comprehensive solutions including program design, system construction, and operation services to meet their diverse needs for solid waste pollution risk control and ecological restoration. The solid waste pollution barrier and remediation system is constructed based on comprehensive assessment and analysis of factors such as the characteristics and scope of pollutants, migration pathways, sensitive receptors, and hydrogeological characteristics. It uses specialized materials and equipment to build a pollution control system with functions such as barrier and anti-seepage, collection and drainage, chemical corrosion resistance, and environmental protection and restoration. Depending on the exposure pathways and pollution risk control objectives, the company's solid waste pollution barrier and remediation system can be divided into horizontal barrier systems, vertical barrier systems, and closure barrier systems. The horizontal barrier system is mainly used for new, renovated, and expanded landfill or storage sites to prevent the diffusion of pollutants to the bottom and surrounding areas by constructing a flexible barrier at the bottom of the pollution source. The vertical barrier system is mainly used for landfill or storage sites where horizontal barriers have not been implemented or have experienced leakage due to improper operation, and the bottom soil and groundwater have been contaminated. It isolates and controls the pollution source, contaminated soil, and groundwater within the system, preventing further migration and diffusion of pollutants. The closure barrier system is mainly used for the restoration of expired or non-standard landfill or storage sites. It constructs a flexible barrier at the top of the pollution source to collect and treat landfill gas and leachate in an orderly manner, accelerate the stability of the landfill and reduction of pollutants, and restore the natural landscape and land use value in combination with ecological restoration systems. The system effectively controls the pollution source within the barrier, prevents the leakage of pollutants to the bottom and surrounding areas, and collects and drains leachate and landfill gas in an orderly manner for treatment or safe disposal. It also includes the construction of groundwater drainage layers in the horizontal barrier and the collection and drainage of leachate and landfill gas. Microbial degradation principles can be utilized to create a favorable microbial reaction environment, accelerate the stability of the landfill and reduction of pollutants. The flexible barrier at the top of the pollution source prevents rainwater infiltration and reduces the generation of leachate. The remediation of polluted sites restores the natural landscape and land use value, making them suitable for parks, green spaces, etc. The orderly drainage of surface runoff after closure prevents the sliding and damage of the ecological restoration layer. Huai Bei City Municipal Solid Waste Sanitary Landfill Project: This project is a large-scale high-standard municipal solid waste and incineration fly ash landfill project implemented by the company. It has a designed capacity of 870,000 m3 and was completed in September 2019. The services provided include the construction of horizontal barrier systems, groundwater collection and drainage systems, leachate collection and drainage systems, landfill gas collection and drainage systems, etc. Guilin Chongkou Municipal Solid Waste Sanitary Landfill Closure Project: This project is a comprehensive closure project for an early large-scale sanitary landfill. It covers an area of 117,200 m2 and was completed in July 2018. The services provided include the construction of vertical barrier systems, leachate collection and drainage systems, landfill gas collection and drainage systems, closure barrier systems, surface runoff drainage systems, ecological restoration systems, etc. 2. Solid Waste Treatment and Disposal Business: China produces a huge amount of solid waste, and reducing the quantity of solid waste through scientific means and utilizing it as a resource is the fundamental way to solve the problem of solid waste pollution. The company's solid waste treatment and disposal business mainly includes the treatment and disposal of sludge and hazardous waste. (1) Sludge Treatment and Disposal: Sludge is a semi-solid or solid substance generated during the wastewater treatment process. It has the following characteristics: high organic content, complex composition, contains parasitic eggs, microorganisms, heavy metals, etc., and has water content and interactions with multiple media, poor compressibility, and stability. If not properly disposed of, it will face difficulties in storage, transportation, and secondary pollution. To address the characteristics and challenges of sludge disposal, the company adopts the ""conditioning and modification + high-pressure dewatering + drying and carbonization"" technology route. It can provide customized solutions including program design, equipment development, system integration, and operation services based on the differences in sewage quality, treatment processes, and specific disposal needs in different regions, enabling customers to achieve sludge reduction and volume reduction safely and efficiently. The company has independently developed a steel structure plate and frame filter press, which can achieve rapid mud-water separation with a dehydration process of only 45-50 minutes. It has advantages such as high filtration efficiency, convenient sludge removal, and high strength. At the same time, the company combines the high-pressure dewatering process with the drying and carbonization process to reduce the moisture content of the sludge to below 60% using the plate and frame filter press, and then carry out drying and carbonization treatment. This greatly improves the economic viability of the carbonization process. The final product, sludge-based biochar, has low moisture content and water solubility, meets the standards for garden soil and can be further utilized as organic fertilizer or raw material for building materials. Kaili Sewage Treatment Plant Sludge Disposal and Upgrading BOT Project: This project is a representative large-scale sludge high-pressure dewatering and drying carbonization project in Guizhou Province. It was implemented in two phases, with the first phase of high-pressure dewatering completed in 2016 and the second phase of drying and carbonization completed in 2018. The services provided include the treatment of sludge with 80% moisture content from sewage treatment plants in the administrative area of Kaili City. The sludge is subjected to conditioning and modification, high-pressure dewatering, and then drying and carbonization. The daily output is 15 tons of carbonized product - sludge-based biochar, which is used for resource utilization such as organic fertilizer blending and production of building materials. (2) Hazardous Waste Treatment and Disposal: The company's hazardous waste treatment and disposal business involves the harmless treatment and resource utilization of hazardous waste in accordance with national standards and market demand. The company's waste oil and waste emulsion treatment and disposal project is implemented by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Avis Environmental Protection. It is planned to be put into operation in September 2020. The main business is the pretreatment of waste oil and waste emulsion transferred to the company, followed by high-temperature cracking and distillation to produce and sell fuel oil and other resource products. The company's waste acid treatment and disposal project is implemented by its holding subsidiary, Tongyuan Da, and is currently in the trial operation stage. The main business is the pretreatment of waste acid transferred to the company. The acid and other substances are separated from the valuable raw materials through processes such as modulation, impurity removal, filtration, concentration, and drying and crystallization. The resulting products, such as manganese sulfate and manganese carbonate, are sold as resource products. During the reporting period, the waste oil and waste emulsion treatment and disposal project and the waste acid treatment and disposal project were in the construction stage and had not yet generated revenue. 3. Water Environment Remediation Business: The company's water environment remediation business mainly includes the comprehensive treatment of urban black and odorous water bodies, river and lake regulation and water quality improvement, and comprehensive treatment of village and town sewage. The company follows the ""source control, internal treatment, and ecological restoration"" approach in water pollution control. It provides customers with comprehensive solutions including program design, equipment development, project implementation, and operation and maintenance services based on the principles of tailored strategies for each region and each river. The company has independently developed a river and lake sediment integrated treatment and disposal equipment system, which can achieve on-site treatment and disposal of river and lake sediments through processes such as screening and impurity removal, environmental conditioning, dehydration and drying, and residual water treatment. The dewatering process does not require the addition of alkaline agents such as lime. The resulting mud cake can meet the requirements for various resource utilization methods such as garden soil and production of sintered bricks, achieving reduction, harmlessness, stabilization, and resource utilization of river and lake sediments. Due to its unique modular structure design, the equipment system can be quickly assembled and has advantages such as high automation, small footprint, mobility, strong processing capacity, and low cost. Xi Yang Lake AB Lake and Xuri Tiandu Black and Odorous Water Body Treatment Project: This project is an early water environment remediation project in Anhui Province. The water quality indicators (COD, ammonia nitrogen, TP) meet the requirements of Class IV surface water in the ""Surface Water Environmental Quality Standards"" (GB3838-2002). It was completed in March 2018. The services provided include source control and interception, in-situ purification of sewage and initial rainwater along the water body's coastline to reduce the external pollution load and avoid the impact of external pollution on the water body's ecosystem; internal treatment, including dredging of organic pollutants and nutrients in the water body and in-situ treatment and disposal of sediments to eliminate internal pollution; ecological restoration, including the planting of aquatic plants (with a coverage rate of over 70% for submerged plants), construction of ecological floating islands, and supplementary measures such as artificial aeration to reconstruct a healthy water ecosystem and gradually restore the self-purification capacity of the water body. 4. Interconnection between Business Segments: The solid waste pollution barrier and remediation, solid waste treatment and disposal, and water environment remediation businesses are all part of the solid waste management industry. In the early stages of development, the company focused on constructing landfill sites for municipal solid waste, sludge, river and lake sediments, and industrial solid waste using solid waste pollution barrier technologies to achieve the harmless disposal of solid waste. However, with the development of the national economy, the generation and growth of solid waste have increased significantly. Therefore, reducing the quantity of solid waste and utilizing it as a resource became the key to solving solid waste pollution. The company started with the most challenging sludge and river and lake sediments in landfill acceptance and conducted technological research and development. It gradually developed core technologies such as sludge high-pressure dewatering and carbonization treatment and river and lake sediment integrated treatment and disposal, aiming to achieve maximum reduction of sludge and river and lake sediments and their resource utilization. While continuously improving the layout of solid waste pollution control business, the company entered the field of water environment remediation by relying on the river and lake sediment integrated treatment and disposal technology to address internal pollution control in water bodies. The company's river and lake sediment integrated treatment and disposal technology is an important means of internal pollution control in water environment remediation.

"The company's main products are thin film products used in the new energy industry, with EVA and POE adhesives as the main product structures. These include transparent EVA film, white efficiency-enhancing EVA film, POE film, and other polymer films. They are used for encapsulation on the underside of photovoltaic module cells. They are widely used in high-efficiency cells such as single-crystal PERC double-sided and N-type cell modules. They are also used in various fields such as architectural curtain walls, building facades, interior glass, automotive glass, and optics. EVA film and POE film are made from EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer) resin and POE (polyolefin elastomer) resin, respectively, by adding suitable crosslinking agents and anti-aging agents and then melt extruding them into films using the flow casting method. As the core material for photovoltaic modules, encapsulation films protect the fragile solar cells, allowing the modules to operate without being affected by external environments, extending their lifespan, and maximizing sunlight transmission to the cells to enhance the power generation efficiency of the modules. Photovoltaic encapsulation films need to ensure a 25-year lifespan for solar modules and are essential core auxiliary materials in the photovoltaic industry. EVA film has characteristics such as high transmittance, resistance to UV, humidity, and yellowing, and good adhesion to glass and backsheet. POE film has characteristics such as high resistance to PID. Both are key materials for photovoltaic module encapsulation and are suitable for encapsulating crystalline silicon cells, thin-film cells, and other photovoltaic components. They are used in the lamination process of cell module encapsulation, covering both sides of the cells and bonding with the upper glass and lower backsheet (or glass) through vacuum lamination technology to form the photovoltaic module. In addition to the photovoltaic industry, EVA film can also be used for encapsulation in applications related to transparent packaging in the building materials glass, automotive glass, and electronic display industries. Since Germany launched the Million Solar Roofs program in the early 21st century, the use of films in the photovoltaic industry has attracted attention with the booming development of the solar energy industry in China. In the early stages, photovoltaic module manufacturers mainly used imported films, with suppliers mainly being international well-known companies such as STR and 3M from the United States, and Bridgestone and Mitsui from Japan. With the continuous localization of the photovoltaic industry chain, the development of photovoltaic encapsulation films has been more than ten years, and the import substitution has been achieved. The issuer has been deeply involved in the film industry for more than ten years and has become one of the major players in the industry. EVA film is the core encapsulation material required in the production process of photovoltaic modules, with one layer used between the glass surface and the cells, and another layer used between the cells and the backsheet, thus forming the upper and lower layers. In the early stages of industry development, the products were single-layer transparent EVA films used for both upper and lower layers of the modules. Although with the development of module technology, the lower layer film tends to be white efficiency-enhancing EVA film, and the application of transparent EVA film in the lower layer has been partially replaced by white efficiency-enhancing EVA film, there is still a high market demand for transparent EVA film when used in double-layer or paired with other films in the modules' upper layer. Transparent anti-PID EVA film for photovoltaic modules is the company's traditional product. In the early stages of the company's entry into the industry, in order to improve power generation efficiency, it was customary in the industry to reduce the refractive index of the silicon nitride protective layer on the surface of photovoltaic cells to increase sunlight transmittance. After using this technology for a period of time, it was found that when the refractive index of the cell's protective layer was reduced, the cell was more prone to failure under external voltage environments, resulting in potential-induced degradation (PID), which refers to the rapid decrease in power generation efficiency of photovoltaic modules due to system bias and environmental influences during use. To ensure a 25-year lifespan for photovoltaic modules while improving power generation efficiency became a challenge for the industry at that time. The issuer focused on technological research and development and in 2012 developed anti-PID EVA film (anti-potential-induced degradation film) for photovoltaic cell modules used in high-temperature and high-humidity coastal, lakeside, and riverside areas, as well as areas with severe morning and evening dew. This film effectively reduces the power generation efficiency degradation of photovoltaic modules in such environments, solves the technical problem of anti-PID in the industry, and ensures the module's lifespan. It became one of the first suppliers to introduce such products. With the continuous improvement of industry quality standards, anti-PID performance gradually became one of the necessary technical requirements for EVA film. The issuer's anti-PID EVA film has been widely used among customers and has become a standard product in the photovoltaic encapsulation film industry. The introduction of transparent anti-PID EVA film products by the company has established its industry position with technological research and development capabilities as the core competitive advantage. To solve the problem of light leakage between cells in early single-sided double-glass modules, where both sides used transparent EVA film and the backside used transparent glass without a white backsheet to reflect light, resulting in a power loss of more than 2%, the company started the research and development of white efficiency-enhancing EVA film. It went through the process of applying it to thin-film cell modules, double-glass modules, and finally to the most challenging single-glass module encapsulation. The white efficiency-enhancing EVA film developed by the company is an upgraded product in the photovoltaic encapsulation film technology. It is applied to the underside of the cells to improve the utilization efficiency of sunlight in the module and thus enhance the power generation efficiency of the solar module. Transparent EVA film only plays a role in light transmission, adhesion, and resistance to yellowing, while white efficiency-enhancing EVA film has high reflectivity. By changing the path of light reflection, it allows sunlight to reach the cell surface again after being reflected by the glass, effectively improving the module's efficiency. In the lower encapsulation layer of double-glass modules, white efficiency-enhancing EVA film is used instead of transparent EVA film, resulting in a power gain of 7-10W per module. In ordinary 60-cell single-glass modules, the use of white efficiency-enhancing EVA film can achieve a power gain of 1-3W. With the widespread use of PERC double-sided cells, thin and flexible cells, half-cut and multi-busbar technologies, as well as 72-cell large modules in the past one to two years, the power difference between modules using and not using white efficiency-enhancing EVA film is close to 5W, which is a significant power level, making the gain effect of white efficiency-enhancing EVA film more pronounced. A comparison between transparent EVA film and white efficiency-enhancing EVA film shows that they have characteristics such as high resistance to PID, high transmittance, resistance to UV, humidity, yellowing, and resistance to snail patterns, as well as good adhesion to glass and backsheet. They can be used for single-glass modules, double-glass modules, and thin-film modules, improving the power generation efficiency of solar modules and meeting the high yield encapsulation requirements of single-glass modules, double-glass modules, and thin-film modules. Multi-layer co-extruded POE film is a photovoltaic module encapsulation film whose application scenarios are gradually increasing. Its main raw material, POE resin, is a copolymer of ethylene and octene. POE film can be used for encapsulation in monocrystalline and double-glass modules and has good prospects for application in double-sided PERC cell double-glass modules. Due to the double-sided power generation characteristics of double-sided PERC cells and the design of backside field passivation and local aluminum back field, the backside of the cells is particularly prone to PID, especially in double-glass modules where PID degradation is more pronounced. Compared to EVA film, POE film has higher water vapor barrier properties, better weather resistance, and stronger resistance to PID. Using POE film for encapsulation can effectively avoid PID and improve the power generation efficiency of solar modules. Therefore, the application of POE film in double-sided PERC cell modules is growing. With the trend of double-sided power generation modules and double-glass modules in the photovoltaic industry, the demand for POE film will continue to increase. Currently, the industry mainly uses single-layer POE film, which has the following drawbacks in application: 1) POE resin itself is a non-polar material, while various additives used together are polar materials, resulting in poor compatibility and serious additive precipitation in POE film, leading to unstable performance; 2) The surface of POE film is slippery, making it easy for cells to shift during module production. This phenomenon is more severe when using circular ribbon in the production of high-efficiency multi-busbar modules; 3) The use of POE film requires longer lamination time in the lamination process of photovoltaic module production, resulting in significantly lower production efficiency compared to using EVA film for lamination; 4) POE film is more prone to bubble formation during use, resulting in lower lamination yield of photovoltaic modules. To solve these problems, the company has independently developed a new type of multi-layer co-extruded POE film. This film is an innovative encapsulation film produced by co-extruding POE resin and EVA resin using a co-extrusion process. It is suitable for use in PERC double-sided double-glass modules, N-type double-sided double-glass modules, and other photovoltaic modules with high weather resistance requirements. Multi-layer co-extruded POE film not only has the high water vapor barrier and anti-PID properties of POE material but also has the lamination process characteristics of high yield in double-glass modules similar to EVA material. It is not affected by the relatively short supply of POE resin raw materials. In actual use, the anti-PID performance of multi-layer co-extruded POE film is better than that of single-layer POE film. At the same time, when customers use it, it improves the production efficiency and yield of modules in the production process. Customers can also use it in combination with EVA film, further reducing customer costs. Multi-layer co-extruded POE film has been improved in terms of product performance and processing technology, and it reduces costs and improves efficiency for customers. It has multiple advantages compared to the existing single-layer POE film in the industry and is one of the future development trends for POE encapsulation films. The company is actively exploring and developing special film materials products in non-photovoltaic industries such as building materials, transportation, electronics, and consumer goods based on its core film technology. In the traditional glass industry, to improve the strength and safety of glass, glass films are added between two layers of glass to enhance their strength, safety, sound insulation, and energy-saving effects. They are widely used in architectural glass curtain walls, roofs, glass railings, glass structural components, automotive glass, high-speed rail glass, and ship glass. Currently, the main films used in these fields are PVB and SGP films, and these two types of non-crosslinked films are mainly supplied by overseas manufacturers in high-end architectural glass and automotive glass industries. Traditional EVA film has certain usage limitations due to its low strength and inability to be used in the roll-to-roll equipment of the glass industry. To address the application scenarios in the glass industry, the issuer utilized its technological advantages accumulated in the photovoltaic film industry to develop high-strength roll-to-roll PVE film. It overcomes the disadvantages of traditional EVA film, significantly improves material strength, and is suitable for large-scale roll-to-roll equipment. At the same time, this technology retains the crosslinking characteristics of EVA film and has excellent resistance to humidity, creep, and high and low temperatures. In outdoor, hot, extremely cold, and humid areas, which have always been weak areas for traditional glass films, PVE film surpasses the performance of traditional films in outdoor, hot, extremely cold, and humid environments, expanding the application scenarios and potential market for the company's products. During the reporting period, as an innovator and major promoter of crosslinked roll-to-roll high-strength PVE interlayer films, the issuer participated in the drafting and formulation of the industry group standard ""Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate (EVA) Interlayer Film for Laminated Glass,"" actively promoted the standardization of product technology, and successfully implemented it in practice and industrialization. The company has cooperated with major glass manufacturers in the industry to promote the application of PVE film in the architectural glass industry. In the automotive glass field, with the more fashionable design of new energy vehicles, the application of automotive glass is moving towards larger areas, resulting in higher safety requirements. Since cars are often in high-speed motion and need to meet the requirements of hot or cold climates, PVE film products have more opportunities for application. The company is cooperating with large automotive glass manufacturers to apply its core technology to the automotive glass industry. In the field of electronic materials, since 2019, the company has been laying out the electronic touch screen industry and developing innovative alternative products to the existing OCA optical adhesive. The existing OCA optical adhesive has the disadvantages of low yield and complex production processes when applied to large-sized touch screens, while EVA optical adhesive excels in stable quality, easy rework, and high yield in large-sized applications. With the continuous reduction in the cost of large-sized touch screens and the gradual increase in application demand, EVA optical adhesive has more opportunities to replace the original optical adhesive. The company is currently actively deploying in the market of all-in-one technology optical adhesives, which is a trend in the industry's development, in order to enter the broad space of electronic materials. In summary, the issuer is actively exploring and developing special film materials products in non-photovoltaic industries such as building materials, transportation, electronics, and consumer goods. It aims to gradually develop into a technologically advanced and diversified special polymer film production enterprise."	The translation of '综合' in English is 'comprehensive' or 'synthesis'.	1.

They can be widely used in LED lighting, power adapters, smart home appliances, PC power supplies, industrial control, and high-reliability fields. The device structure of planar MOSFET. Compared with the reverse recovery performance of the body diode of conventional planar MOSFET and fast recovery diode and Schottky diode, its reverse recovery speed is lower and the reverse recovery characteristics are worse. If it is applied in motor control systems and power supply systems such as half-bridge, full-bridge, and LLC, it will increase switching losses, reduce system efficiency, and also generate high ringing, affecting the safe operation of power MOSFETs. In order to reduce the switching losses caused by reverse recovery, the conventional practice is to parallel a FRED (fast recovery diode) with the planar MOSFET. However, due to the parallel connection of FRED and the parasitic body diode of the MOSFET, there is competition, and some current still flows through the parasitic body diode. To avoid this situation, the design and control of the power part will become complex. In response to the above situation, the issuer has designed and developed the integrated fast recovery high-voltage power MOSFET (FRMOS) series products based on the planar MOSFET process platform. Combining independently developed high-voltage MOSFET's minority carrier lifetime control and process implementation technology, the issuer's FRMOS products have the characteristics of low reverse recovery charge and short reverse recovery time.

351	Sontai Inge (Chengdu) CNC Tool Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft)	'通用' translates to 'universal' or 'general' in English.	(1) Tool systems and accessories. The tool system (commonly known as the tool holder in daily use) is a bridge between the machine tool spindle and the cutting tools in the mechanical processing process. It does not directly participate in cutting, but its function is to position and align the tools, transmit the required cutting torque, and ensure quick tool changes. The quality of the tool system directly affects the service life of the machine tool spindle and tools, as well as the quality of the processed workpieces. The tool system generally has a rotary shaft-like shape and consists of a tool handle section and a chuck section: the shape of the tool handle section is mostly tapered, connected to the machine tool spindle interface, and serves as the foundation of the tool system; the chuck section is connected to the cutting tools or work head modules and is used to clamp the tools. The company's tool system series products have the advantages of complete product range, high precision, and excellent performance. The company can produce various specifications of tool system interfaces such as 7:24, HSK, PSC, short cone with steel ball tightening, and TMG21. It also has high-performance chucks such as hydraulic chucks, heat shrink chucks, micro-compensation tapping chucks, high-power milling chucks, and high-speed high-precision spring chucks. The 7:24 tool system is suitable for various boring and milling machines with 7:24 spindle taper holes and machining centers with automatic tool changers. It has a single-sided positioning cone shank and is suitable for medium and low speeds, making it the most widely used type of tool system. Among them, the heat shrink tool holder and hydraulic tool holder, with a high-precision 3μm runout at 4×d, are known as high-end tool systems and are commonly used in precision and efficient machining applications, replacing traditional tool systems. The 3μm runout accuracy at 14×d refers to the runout accuracy at a length 4 times the diameter of the tool holder after the tool is clamped. The longer the extension length, the more difficult it is to maintain the runout accuracy. It is suitable for high-speed and high-precision CNC machine tools with a 1:10 spindle taper hole. The cone shank and end face are in contact at the same time, with an over-positioning design, providing better positioning accuracy and dynamic rigidity. It can meet high-speed machining above 10,000 rpm and is a type of tool system with a large market demand and rapid growth. HSK tool system interfaces can also be matched with heat shrink chucks and hydraulic chucks to achieve a 3μm (4×d) runout accuracy. Tool system accessories are various interchangeable parts that must be assembled together to ensure the normal connection and effective clamping of the tool system with the machine tool, as well as various tools that provide convenience for the normal use of the tool system. During the reporting period, the main tool system accessories sold by the company were retaining rings, pull studs, and heat shrink machines. (2) Cutting tools. Cutting tools are the parts that directly or indirectly participate in cutting in the mechanical processing process. Indexable tools are used to support and hold carbide inserts to maintain normal cutting operations. They are characterized by mechanically clamping polygonal inserts that can be indexed or replaced. The main materials for the tool body of this type of tool are alloy steel, and the main material for the tool inserts is carbide. According to different functions, they can be divided into turning tools, milling tools, and hole processing tools, which can be applied to various metal cutting, milling, cutting, grooving, and other processing operations. They are suitable for turning surface machining of rotating parts and turning operations where the tool remains stationary and the workpiece rotates. According to their functions, they can be divided into external turning tools, internal turning tools, internal and external grooving tools, thread turning tools, etc. After the cutting edge of the indexable insert is worn, it can be replaced with other cutting edges or inserts, which has good interchangeability, economic convenience, and is mainly used in various turning machines. C. Hole processing tools. The tool inserts are the parts that directly participate in cutting metal materials during the cutting process and need to be used in conjunction with the tool body. There are many types of tool insert substrates, including carbide, ceramic metal, CBN, PCD, etc., among which carbide has the largest usage. The substrate of the carbide insert is made by powder metallurgy pressing. With the upgrading of processing and manufacturing equipment and processes, foreign countries have begun to use complex and high-precision full grinding technology to improve the performance of the inserts. In [year], the company officially started mass production of ground inserts. After grinding, the inserts have better surface quality and precision. Ground inserts are often used in conjunction with other products, which can form large-scale production and are one of the company's key future development products. Superhard tools refer to tools that use natural diamonds or superhard materials such as PCD and CBN as the key working parts and tools that work with the help of the superhard materials. Among them, the application of PCD and CBN materials is the most extensive. With the development of the materials industry and precision machinery industry, the use of precision cutting, ultra-precision cutting, and difficult-to-cut materials has increased, and superhard tools will play a greater role in the field of cutting tools in the future. Superhard materials such as PCD or CBN are combined with various alloy or steel tool bodies through welding, and then processed into various cutting edges through processes such as laser, EDM, or grinding. They can be made into different types of tools according to customer needs, such as milling cutters, reamers, boring tools, etc., especially suitable for designing and manufacturing various complex and irregular combination tools. They are mainly used in the efficient processing of various non-ferrous metals and the high-hardness and high-wear-resistant processing of black metals. They are preferred tools for efficient and high-precision machining and can meet the requirements of lightweight manufacturing in the automotive and aviation industries. With years of technical accumulation, the company has comprehensively applied non-directly participating cutting tool technology to the development of superhard tools. After independent processing and treatment, the performance indicators of the superhard tool products can reach the level of imported tools. This production process is synchronized with internationally renowned superhard tool manufacturers and has more technical advantages and overall manufacturing process advantages compared to other domestic superhard tool manufacturers. Superhard tools are one of the company's key development products in recent years, and in the future, the company will continue to expand industrial scale, strengthen research and development investment, and increase its market share in the domestic and international high-end markets. Alloy tools can be divided into integral type and welding type according to the tool structure. Integral alloy tools refer to tools that have cutting edges directly made on the tool body and can directly participate in cutting. Welding alloy tools refer to tools made by combining the hard alloy cutting edge part with the tool body or shank made of other materials through welding. During the reporting period, the main alloy tools sold by the company include integral tools and welding tools, specifically... Fixtures are products used to position and clamp the workpieces being processed in the machining process. When machining workpieces on machine tools, in order to ensure that the surface of the workpiece meets the technical requirements such as the dimensions, geometric shapes, and mutual positional accuracy with other surfaces specified in the drawings, the workpiece must be properly positioned and securely clamped before machining. For a long time, high-precision fixture products have been monopolized by foreign companies. Since 2013, the company has successively developed a series of precision hydraulic fixtures, including internal expansion, external expansion, and end face clamping types. These fixtures have performance comparable to similar foreign products and have the ability to replace imports. In 2018, the company launched high-precision mechanical fixtures, which are widely used in high-end gear manufacturing and robot harmonic reducers, providing conditions for the transformation and upgrading of China's basic industries. The company's products are mainly non-standard and require the design and manufacturing of fixtures to be determined based on the customer's machine tool type, clamping method, and the shape and size of the workpiece being processed. The precision fixture series products are one of the company's key directions for future research and development and promotion. Precision fixtures (hydraulic/mechanical). Hydraulic fixtures, also known as hydraulic expansion fixtures, use hydraulic pressure to drive thin-walled expanding sleeves to expand and position the workpieces. Mechanical fixtures use manual or automatic devices provided by machine tools to push the expanding sleeves, causing relative displacement between the expanding sleeves and the fixture body taper, thereby generating uniform pressure inward or outward to position and clamp the workpieces. Precision fixtures are mainly used for high-precision positioning of machined parts such as gear grinding, gear rolling, and gear shaving, with a positioning accuracy of 5μm and a repeat positioning accuracy of 2μm. They have the advantages of high repeatability, strong clamping force, good precision retention, long service life, and easy use, especially when combined with machine tools to achieve automated clamping.

"The company is a provider of automotive powertrain electronic control systems, with main business activities including research and development, production, sales, and technical services of automotive engine management systems, motorcycle engine management systems, pure electric vehicle powertrain electronic control systems, and hybrid vehicle powertrain electronic control systems. The engine management system (EMS) consists of three components: the engine electronic control unit (ECU), sensors, and actuators. The EMS uses the ECU as the control center, detecting relevant engine operating parameters through various sensors installed on the engine and vehicle (such as coolant temperature sensors, intake temperature and pressure sensors, oxygen sensors, etc.), and precisely controlling fuel injection quantity, intake volume, ignition timing, etc. through various actuators (such as injectors, throttle valves, ignition coils, etc.) based on engine control strategies and calibration parameters. This ensures that the engine operates in the optimal state, achieving optimal power output, driving performance, fuel consumption, and compliance with regulatory emissions requirements. The automotive engine management system is one of the key factors determining vehicle fuel consumption, emissions, power, and driving performance, and is the core component of the engine system and the vehicle as a whole. For a long time, the technology of automotive engine management systems has been monopolized by multinational EMS manufacturers such as Bosch and Continental from Germany, Denso from Japan, and Delphi, which has hindered the independent development of China's automotive industry. The company is committed to breaking the situation of ""hollowing out"" of core technologies in the Chinese automotive industry and has successfully developed engine management systems with independent intellectual property rights, achieving localization of automotive powertrain electronic control systems. As of December 31, 2019, the company is one of the only two Chinese independent electronic control companies that have obtained the announcement of China VI emission standards for gasoline vehicles. Since its establishment, the company has always adhered to independent research and development, independently mastering control strategies and underlying complex drive design technologies of electronic control systems, and has the source code with independent intellectual property rights, as well as the ability to continuously optimize and upgrade the electronic control system software platform. In 2008, the company achieved success by using the software platform of the intake efficiency model to match engines with mechanical throttle valves. In 2015, the company achieved success by using the software platform of the torque model to match engines with electronic throttle valves. On December 5, 2018, a vehicle equipped with the company's engine management system product that meets China VI B stage emission standards obtained the announcement from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, becoming the first N1 vehicle to obtain China VI announcement in the Chinese market.

4	Prospectus for the Initial Public Offering of Shares of Mingguan New Materials Co., Ltd. on the Science and Technology Innovation Board (Draft for Review)	High-end equipment	During the reporting period, the company's main product is solar cell backsheet, with sales revenue accounting for over 95% of the total revenue from the main business in each period. Aluminum-plastic film, special protective film, and POE adhesive film are new product types developed by the company, and they have been sold externally during the reporting period, but the sales volume and amount are relatively small. The solar cell backsheet manufacturing industry belongs to the sub-industry of the photovoltaic power generation industry and is an indispensable link in the photovoltaic power generation industry chain, occupying a midstream position in the industry chain. The photovoltaic power generation industry chain includes the following: upstream raw material industries, including silicon materials and silicon rods for producing solar cells, fluorine films, PET base films, and polyolefin films for producing backsheet; midstream industries including glass, solar cells, frames, backsheet, welding strips, EVA adhesive films, junction boxes, and solar cell modules composed of these components, as well as installation system brackets, inverters, etc.; downstream industries include application system links. From the above diagram, it can be seen that the solar cell backsheet manufacturing industry is a sub-industry of the photovoltaic power generation industry and is an indispensable link in the photovoltaic power generation industry chain, occupying a midstream position. Its upstream industries include the supply of raw materials such as fluorine films, PET base films, and polyolefin films, and its downstream industry is the solar cell module industry. The development of the solar cell backsheet manufacturing industry depends on the overall development of the photovoltaic power generation industry. 1. Solar cell backsheet. (1) Product composition. The main raw materials of solar cell backsheet are PET base film, fluorine film, adhesive, and polyolefin film. Among them, PET base film mainly provides insulation performance and mechanical performance, fluorine film provides weather resistance and barrier properties, and also has excellent insulation performance. The main function of the adhesive is to bond the PET base film with the fluorine film and polyolefin film. (2) Company's products. The company's produced backsheet is mainly composed of T-series products (TPM structure and TPT structure) and K-series products (KPM structure and KPK structure), with a certain quantity of BO series products. TPT structure backsheet uses Tedlar® PVF fluorine film produced by DuPont in the United States, which has good weather resistance, mechanical strength, and bonding performance. The reliability of this structure and related materials has been verified in practice, and the product is mainly targeted at major state-owned solar cell module manufacturers. TPM structure backsheet uses Tedlar® PVF fluorine film produced by DuPont in the United States for the outer layer and self-developed polyolefin film for the inner layer. The product has good comprehensive performance and can meet the packaging requirements of high-performance solar cell modules. Compared with TPT structure backsheet, it has cost advantages and is aimed at the majority of solar cell module manufacturers with higher performance requirements. The polyolefin film on the inner side of the backsheet has excellent reliability and better bonding performance with the EVA film in the module than the fluorine film. The product has excellent comprehensive performance, can meet the packaging requirements of most solar cell modules in the industry, and has obvious cost advantages, occupying a large market share of the backsheet. The product is mainly targeted at the majority of solar cell module manufacturers. KPK structure products use PVDF film on both the inner and outer sides. KPK structure has good comprehensive performance, long service life, and high reliability. The product is mainly targeted at state-owned and some private solar cell module manufacturers. BO structure (weather-resistant PET/polyolefin film). BO structure backsheet has better performance than traditional backsheet in terms of low-temperature resistance, water vapor barrier, high reflectivity, etc. It is supported by PET modified with aging resistance as the air-side support material, environmentally friendly, and can meet customers' special requirements. The product is targeted at the majority of mainstream solar cell module manufacturers. The product is targeted at the majority of solar cell module manufacturers with higher performance requirements. The product is mainly targeted at major state-owned solar cell module manufacturers. The product is mainly targeted at state-owned and some private solar cell module manufacturers. The product is mainly targeted at overseas solar module manufacturers and manufacturers with environmental protection requirements. Overall, TPT and TPM backsheet using DuPont PVF fluorine film have better weather resistance and sand resistance in testing compared to other fluorine film structure backsheet, so their product cost is higher than other models. Single-sided fluorine film backsheet and BO backsheet products, due to the use of the company's independently developed M film, have a reflectivity of around 80%-90% or even higher, compared to the T film with a reflectivity of about 70% for double-sided fluorine film backsheet, resulting in a 1-2W increase in module power. At the same time, its bonding strength is better than that of double-layer fluorine film backsheet products. Solar backsheet is mainly used for the encapsulation of the back of solar cell modules and is mainly used in the field of photovoltaic power generation. Currently, solar cells on the market are mainly divided into crystalline silicon solar cells and thin-film solar cells, with crystalline silicon solar cells being the most widely used. The key material for photovoltaic conversion in crystalline silicon solar cells is solar cell wafers. After series connection, solar cell wafers are encapsulated and protected by solar cell backsheet, frames, etc., and then combined with controllers, installation system brackets, and other components to form a photovoltaic power generation system. Protecting crystalline silicon solar cell wafers generally requires high transmittance and special strengthening treatment. Solar cell encapsulation film provides structural support for solar cell circuit equipment, maximizes light coupling between the cell and solar radiation, physically isolates the cell and circuit, and conducts heat generated by the cell. It converts light energy into electrical energy, provides sealing, insulation, waterproofing, and corrosion resistance, and plays a role in current transfer station to protect the entire power generation system. Aluminum-plastic film is used for lithium-ion batteries, abbreviated as aluminum-plastic film, which is a packaging material for soft-pack lithium-ion batteries and provides protection for the internal materials of lithium-ion batteries. Soft-pack lithium-ion batteries have been widely used in the fields of 3C smart digital products, new energy electric vehicles, and energy storage equipment due to their high safety performance, light weight, thin thickness, and high energy density. Aluminum-plastic film is usually composed of multiple layers of materials compounded by adhesive. Due to the high difficulty in the production process of aluminum-plastic film, most domestically produced aluminum-plastic films do not meet the requirements in terms of resistance to electrolyte corrosion and deep drawing performance, so the global and domestic aluminum-plastic film market is mainly monopolized by a few Japanese companies such as DNP Printing and Showa Denko. During the reporting period, the company's aluminum-plastic film products have been produced and sold in large quantities, and with the continuous improvement of production technology and the expansion of the sales market, aluminum-plastic film will become a new profit growth point for the company, which will also accelerate the import substitution process of the aluminum-plastic film market in China. 3. Special protective film. In addition to solar cell backsheet and aluminum-plastic film products, the company is currently developing other products, including special protective films for electrical appliances and building materials. The special protective film developed by the company is a new type of film material composed of weather-resistant PET film and release film or fluorine film, PET film, and polymer adhesive film, which can be widely used in photovoltaics, outdoor building materials, high-speed rail and aircraft interiors, outdoor billboards, and space films. Since 2018, the company's special protective film products have been produced and shipped in large quantities. Samples of special protective film applications. Solar cell encapsulation film is located in the middle of the solar cell module, wrapping the cell and bonding with the glass and backsheet. It needs to have characteristics such as high water vapor barrier rate, high visible light transmittance, high volume resistivity, weather resistance, and anti-PID performance. EVA film is currently the most widely used solar cell encapsulation film material, for specific details, please refer to the above introduction of solar module components. EVA film occupies more than 80% of the market share due to its excellent encapsulation performance, good aging resistance, and low price. However, in recent years, the gradually developed POE film made of polyolefin has been favored by the high-end photovoltaic market due to its outstanding barrier properties and excellent weather resistance, and its market share has been increasing year by year. During the reporting period, the company's POE film has been produced and shipped in large quantities, and with the increase in the market share of double-glass modules, POE film will become one of the company's new profit growth points.

75	Guangzhou Fangbang Electronics Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft for Review)	High-end equipment	1. Electromagnetic shielding film. (1) Introduction to electromagnetic shielding. Electronic components generate electromagnetic waves when they are in operation. These waves can interact with electronic components and cause interference, known as electromagnetic interference. When electronic components are in operation, they can be affected by their own electromagnetic interference as well as electromagnetic interference from other electronic components, and they can also generate electromagnetic interference to other electronic components. If the electromagnetic interference exceeds the allowable value of the electronic component, it will affect its normal operation. Electromagnetic shielding is a method of effectively suppressing electromagnetic interference by using a shield made of special materials to confine electromagnetic waves within a certain range and suppress or attenuate their electromagnetic radiation. (2) Electromagnetic shielding film is the core material for suppressing electromagnetic interference in FPC. With the rapid development of the modern electronic information industry, higher requirements have been put forward for computing power and transmission speed. The number and density of electronic components have increased rapidly, and electronic components and their components tend to be high-frequency and high-speed. For example, in addition to the original voice call function, mobile phones now commonly have functions such as photography, video playback, data transmission, wireless LAN, fingerprint recognition, positioning, and gravity sensing. The trend of high-frequency and high-speed components is becoming more significant in the future. The electromagnetic interference and signal attenuation problems caused by high-frequency and high-speed driving have gradually become serious in the internal and external of electronic components and their components. Suppressing electromagnetic interference and reducing signal transmission loss have become important issues in the development of FPC. FPC requires the shielding material to be thin, lightweight, flexible, have high bending resistance, high peel strength, low grounding resistance, and meet the requirements for electromagnetic shielding effectiveness. Traditional electromagnetic shielding materials, such as conductive fabric, conductive silicone, and metal shielding devices, cannot simultaneously meet all the requirements of FPC for shielding. The invention of electromagnetic shielding film provides a solution for electromagnetic shielding in FPC and has achieved good application results. Electromagnetic shielding film can effectively suppress electromagnetic interference and reduce signal transmission loss, thereby reducing signal integrity. It has become an important raw material for FPC and is widely used in electronic products such as smartphones and tablets. (3) Categories of electromagnetic shielding film. Currently, there are three main types of electromagnetic shielding film: conductive adhesive type, metal alloy type, and micro-needle type. Conductive adhesive type electromagnetic shielding film. Structure: A conductive adhesive layer (containing conductive particles) is applied on the insulation layer. Features: Higher material cost, lower shielding effectiveness, thicker thickness, and relatively simple structure and production process. Metal alloy type electromagnetic shielding film. Structure: A metal alloy layer (mainly copper and silver) is applied on the insulation layer, and a conductive adhesive layer (containing conductive particles) is applied on top of the metal alloy layer (thinner). Features: Higher shielding effectiveness, more complex structure and production process. Micro-needle type electromagnetic shielding film. Structure: A needle-shaped metal alloy layer (mainly copper) is applied on the insulation layer, and a non-conductive adhesive layer (without conductive particles) is applied on top of the metal alloy layer. The micro-needles pierce the adhesive layer to achieve conductivity. Features: High shielding effectiveness, while significantly reducing attenuation of high-frequency signals during transmission (low insertion loss), and more complex structure. (4) Introduction to the issuer's electromagnetic shielding film. The HSF6000 series electromagnetic shielding film is a series of products launched by the issuer since 2012 and continuously improved. It has high shielding effectiveness, excellent flexibility, and excellent technical indicators. After the launch of HSF6000, the issuer continued to improve the product, and it has gradually been recognized by downstream customers and widely used in mobile phones. The HSF-USB3 series electromagnetic shielding film is a new type of electromagnetic shielding film launched by the issuer in 2014. It further improves the shielding effectiveness and significantly reduces signal transmission loss and signal integrity. After being introduced to the market, it has achieved good results and has been applied to terminal products of brands such as Samsung, Huawei, OPPO, VIVO, and Xiaomi, and can also be applied to emerging fields such as 5G. Conductive adhesive film is a connecting material that provides mechanical and electrical connections between electronic components and circuit boards. It has high peel strength, excellent conductivity, and good solderability, making it one of the important packaging materials for wireless communication terminals. Conductive adhesive film is widely used in various electronic fields such as microelectronic packaging, multilayer printed circuit boards, and conductive wire bonding, and has received increasing attention in recent years. The TCF4000 series conductive adhesive film uses a unique process to uniformly mix resin and conductive particles, forming a uniformly thick conductive adhesive layer with high peel strength. It also has carrier film and protective film on both sides, with specific structure. 3. Ultra-thin flexible copper-clad laminate. (1) Introduction to flexible copper-clad laminate. Flexible copper-clad laminate (FCCL) is the processing substrate of FPC, consisting of flexible insulation layers and metal foils. According to the product structure, flexible copper-clad laminate can be divided into three-layer FCCL and two-layer FCCL, and according to the product thickness, each type of flexible copper-clad laminate can be further divided into ordinary type and ultra-thin type. Advantages: Better heat resistance, moisture resistance, and stability; used for manufacturing COF flexible. The rapid development of downstream electronic products has driven continuous innovation and breakthroughs in FPC manufacturing technology towards high performance and lightweight, thereby continuously increasing the requirements for high-density interconnection (HDI) technology in FPC. Ultra-thin flexible copper-clad laminate is one of the key materials for achieving high-density interconnection technology. (2) Introduction to ultra-thin flexible copper-clad laminate. Ordinary flexible copper-clad laminate is mainly made of copper foil and insulation layers. It is difficult and costly to produce ultra-thin flexible copper-clad laminate using this process. The issuer uses independently developed precision coating equipment, vacuum sputtering equipment, roll-to-roll electroplating equipment, and related process technologies and formulations, and has a higher cost-performance ratio. ① Ultra-thin three-layer flexible copper-clad laminate. ② Ultra-thin two-layer flexible copper-clad laminate. The issuer uses a combination of coating and sputtering processes to achieve high peel strength in ultra-thin two-layer flexible copper-clad laminate (2L-FCCL). The issuer applies a self-developed thermoplastic polyimide resin (TPI) on the surface of the PI film, and after curing, sputters a metal layer on its surface, and then electroplates/thickens it. With this method, the thickness of copper can be below 9μm, and the peel strength can reach above 9N/cm. The issuer uses independently developed or improved precision coating equipment, vacuum sputtering equipment, roll-to-roll electroplating equipment, and related process technologies and formulations, and has a higher cost-performance ratio. With the rapid development of the electronic circuit industry, the integration of component functions is becoming more widespread, and electronic products have higher requirements for copper-clad laminate (CCL) and printed circuit boards (PCB) in terms of high density. High-end printed circuit board (PCB) products such as high-layer boards, HDI boards, flexible boards, and packaging substrates have gradually occupied the market. At the same time, copper foil, as an important material for copper-clad laminate (CCL) and printed circuit board (PCB), also needs to have higher performance, functionality, quality, and reliability. Ultra-thin copper foil is an important material for meeting the requirements of high-performance printed circuit boards (PCB). Ultra-thin copper foil can meet the requirements of PCB for fine line, high density, and thin layer, and can also adapt to the requirements of high reliability and high-frequency signal transmission of PCB. It can be used as a carrier for lithium-ion battery negative electrode materials and as a negative electrode electronic collector and transmission medium. It has a smooth surface, uniform thickness, strong corrosion resistance, and good conductivity.

83	Guangzhou Bibite Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft)	High-end equipment	"Biotech is a biopharmaceutical company focused on innovative drug development with a clinical value-oriented approach. The company specializes in major disease areas such as tumors, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic diseases. Leveraging its core technology platform, the company continuously develops globally pioneering drugs (First-in-Class) for urgent clinical needs and innovative drugs for unmet clinical demands. The company adheres to the vision of ""dedicated to innovation, pursuing excellence,"" insisting on independent innovation and committed to developing innovative drugs with global independent intellectual property rights that are safe and effective.1. Independent research and development capabilities and core technology platform: The company's founder, Qian Changgeng, has over 30 years of experience in international innovative drug research and development. Leading the research and development team, he was the first in the industry to propose the concept of small molecule dual-target inhibitors targeting epigenetic regulation and protein kinase inhibition. He has published multiple articles in journals such as Cancer Research and Clinical Cancer Research and authored books on multi-target drug design. The company has established a core research and development team with a reasonable age gradient, professional structure, and rich experience in innovative drug development through internal cultivation and external talent introduction. It has built a complete new drug development system, covering target research and mechanism validation, compound molecular design and optimization, preclinical evaluation, translational research, chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC), clinical trial design and execution, and new drug registration.The company has gradually formed three distinctive core technology platforms through the development of numerous innovative drugs: a new drug discovery platform, an anti-tumor drug resistance combination therapy platform, and a differentiated clinical design and development platform. Based on extensive research on drug targets and signaling pathways, the company adheres to a clinical value-oriented target selection and compound structure design and optimization strategy. With efficient early-stage drug development and translational medicine capabilities, it has established evaluation systems in pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology, gradually establishing and improving the new drug discovery platform. The company has developed the world's first orally administered small molecule dual-target inhibitor BEBT-908, the first selective ChK1 inhibitor BEBT-260 to enter clinical stage in China, as well as differentiated drugs with advantages such as BEBT-209 and BEBT-109.Deeply rooted in anti-tumor drug development, the company is familiar with the primary and acquired resistance mechanisms of targeted drugs that have emerged in recent years. Based on in-depth research on the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway and HDAC histone deacetylation's epigenetic regulation, the company has gradually established an anti-tumor drug resistance combination therapy platform. It has initiated multiple combination therapy projects guided by the synergistic anti-tumor effect of BEBT-908 for various drug-resistant malignant tumors lacking effective treatment options and has entered the clinical trial stage.Utilizing the advantages of its own projects, the company has adopted a differentiated clinical design and development strategy, forming a highly capable specialized clinical management team responsible for project implementation and establishing and improving a differentiated clinical design and development platform. Different from similar targeted drugs, the clinical trials of BEBT-908, BEBT-209, and BEBT-109 focus on malignant tumors that have unmet clinical needs or develop resistance to standard treatments. Different from the first-generation HSP90 inhibitors used for tumor treatment with significant safety issues, the company's founder invented the second-generation HSP90 inhibitor BEBT-305, which is safe and structurally novel, as the world's first orally administered HSP90 inhibitor for the treatment of psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases. Different from similar PPAR single subtype agonists used for the treatment of diabetes and other metabolic diseases, the company has designed and developed the highly active pan-PPAR agonist BEBT-503 for the treatment of diabetes combined with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Through its efficient core technology platform, the company has developed a series of innovative targeted drugs with independent intellectual property rights and market competitiveness, covering tumor diseases such as lymphoma, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, and metabolic diseases such as diabetes combined with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.2. Core product pipeline layout: Since its establishment, the company has been focusing on disease areas with significant unmet treatment needs, such as tumors, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic diseases. It has established a differentiated and competitive research and development pipeline and has obtained more than 20 clinical trial approvals. The company's research and development pipeline includes six independently developed innovative drug core products that are in or about to enter clinical trials. These core products have significant advantages and characteristics.BEBT-908 is the world's first (First-in-Class) small molecule dual-target inhibitor designed for PI3K/HDAC and has entered critical clinical trials. It is used for the treatment of various hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. BEBT-908 innovatively targets both PI3K and HDAC, selectively inhibiting the core protein kinase target PI3K and the epigenetic regulation target HDAC, which have synergistic effects on tumor cells. Compared to single-target drugs, it has stronger ability to disrupt tumor cell signaling networks and has powerful synergistic killing effects on tumor cells, overcoming the limitations of inherent or acquired resistance to single-target drugs. The BEBT-908 project has received support from the ""Thirteenth Five-Year"" National Major New Drug Creation Science and Technology Major Project and has successfully passed acceptance. Based on excellent clinical data, BEBT-908 obtained the qualification of ""Breakthrough Therapy Drug"" from the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) in October 2021. As of May 31, 2022, the critical clinical trial of BEBT-908 for the treatment of r/rDLBCL has enrolled 82 patients, and it is expected to submit a new drug application (NDA) to the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in early 2023, becoming the first targeted small molecule drug for the treatment of r/rDLBCL in China. In addition, BEBT-908 is undergoing Phase II clinical trials for various other hematologic malignancies. Preclinical studies have shown that BEBT-908, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other drugs, has broad and good anti-tumor activity against various solid tumors. The company is conducting Phase Ib/II clinical trials for the treatment of various advanced solid tumors with BEBT-908 as a monotherapy and in combination with BEBT-209 and CDK4/6 inhibitors and endocrine therapy for relapsed or metastatic HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. Phase Ib/II clinical trials for the treatment of EGFR-mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer after third-generation EGFR-TKI treatment with BEBT-908 in combination with BEBT-109 have also been initiated.BEBT-209 is a highly selective CDK4/6 inhibitor developed by the company for the treatment of advanced breast cancer. Different from marketed CDK4/6 inhibitors, BEBT-209 improves the selectivity of CDK4 and reduces CDK6 inhibitory activity through compound structure design, aiming to reduce hematological and immune suppression toxicities caused by CDK6 activity inhibition. It also achieves better anti-tumor activity by increasing the maximum absorption and exposure of the compound while ensuring safety. Consistent with the company's concept of high selectivity for CDK4, Pfizer is conducting Phase I clinical trials of the CDK4 inhibitor PF-07220060 in the United States.The first indication for BEBT-209 is the combination therapy with fulvestrant for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, and endocrine-resistant advanced breast cancer. Preliminary research results have shown that BEBT-209 has significantly better efficacy than the first marketed CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib and lower hematological side effects. As of the signing date of this prospectus, the Phase III clinical trial of BEBT-209 in combination with fulvestrant for the second-line treatment of HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer has started enrolling subjects, and it is expected to submit a new drug application (NDA) in 2024.BEBT-109 is a highly active pan-mutant EGFR inhibitor developed by the company for the treatment of EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. Different from the first marketed third-generation EGFR inhibitor osimertinib, BEBT-109 increases the maximum blood drug concentration (Cmax), appropriately shortens the half-life of covalent irreversible EGFR inhibitors, and overcomes the defect of osimertinib metabolite inhibiting wild-type EGFR, thereby improving the safety of the product. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that BEBT-109 has high inhibitory activity not only against common EGFR mutations and T790M resistance mutations but also against rare mutations such as EGFR exon 20 insertions. As of the signing date of this prospectus, BEBT-109 has entered Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR exon 20 insertions, and the company plans to communicate with the CDE and obtain conditional approval based on the results of Phase II single-arm clinical trials.BEBT-260 is a highly selective ChK1 inhibitor independently developed by the company and the first ChK1 inhibitor to enter clinical stage in China. It is mainly used for the treatment of advanced solid tumors with P53 mutations. Through compound structure optimization, preclinical studies have shown that BEBT-260 has higher anti-tumor activity and safety than similar compounds. It also increases stability in human liver microsomes and S9, significantly prolonging the half-life. Currently, BEBT-260 has entered Phase Ib clinical trials and is expected to start Phase II clinical trials in 2023.BEBT-305 is the world's first orally administered HSP90 inhibitor for the treatment of psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases, invented by the company's founder. The first indication for BEBT-305, the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, has obtained clinical trial approval from the CDE and is expected to start Phase I clinical trials in the third quarter of 2022.BEBT-503 is a highly active pan-PPAR agonist developed by the company for the treatment of diabetes combined with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. It has submitted an application for Phase I clinical trials in Australia and is expected to start Phase I clinical trials in the third quarter of 2022.Among the investigational products in the IND stage, BEBT-607 is a highly active KRASG12C inhibitor independently developed by the company for the treatment of KRASG12C-mutant solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer. It is expected to submit a clinical trial application in the third quarter of 2022.BEBT-808 is an orally administered small molecule GLP-1R full agonist developed by the company for the treatment of diabetes and obesity. It is expected to submit a clinical trial application in 2023. Pfizer's PF-06882961 is currently the only small molecule GLP-1R full agonist in Phase II clinical trials globally.As multiple core products progress to late-stage development, the company is accelerating the construction of commercialization capabilities, including establishing production bases in accordance with GMP standards and planning to form a marketing team with experience in promoting and selling innovative drugs. The company has a core management team with creativity, professionalism, and a global perspective. They have rich experience in preclinical research, clinical trials, and new drug registration. The company is gradually building teams for industrialization and commercialization, laying a solid foundation for the company's long-term development."

It has entered domestic well-known automotive supporting facilities suppliers such as Desay SV for testing and has been sold. The company's independently developed automotive 1Gbps Ethernet physical layer chip has entered the engineering sampling stage. With the development trend of contemporary automobiles represented by new energy vehicles towards electrification, networking, intelligence, and sharing, the CAN bus used in traditional automobiles is difficult to meet the requirements of modern automobiles in terms of cost and performance. The company's vehicle Ethernet physical layer chips are expected to gradually be widely used in the trend of intelligentization of new energy vehicles, especially in the trend of the gradual growth of domestic new energy vehicles. With the advantages of localized services, excellent product performance, and stable domestic supply chain, the company can quickly increase its product revenue in the field of new energy. Based on Ethernet physical layer chips, the company will gradually expand its product line to upper-layer chip fields such as switching links. Two new products, independently developed Ethernet switching chips and network card chips, have entered the sampling stage. In the future, the company will continue to enrich its product ecosystem and provide customers at home and abroad with a full range of wired communication chip products with higher comprehensive value. The company is composed of a technical development team and excellent management and marketing teams with backgrounds in internationally renowned enterprises. In recent years, the company has been awarded multiple honorary titles such as ""A-level Industrial Enterprise in Jiangsu Province in 2021"" and ""Jiangsu Province High-tech Cultivation Enterprise."" It has been recognized as the Suzhou Enterprise Engineering Technology Research Center and has cooperated with several well-known domestic institutions such as China Information and Communication Research Institute and FiberHome to formulate special Ethernet communication standards. In the future, the company will adhere to the corporate culture of ""efficiency first, pursuit of excellence,"" maintain respect for the market and customers, continuously improve company systems and processes, rely on core technology to continuously invest in research and development resources, expand product lines, and supply domestic high-end wired communication chip products to more customers and more market sectors, becoming a leading enterprise in China's wired communication chip industry."""

254	Suzhou Nawei Technology Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft for Review)	High-end equipment	"The company's current products and services mainly involve two major application areas: biopharmaceuticals and flat panel displays. In the field of biopharmaceuticals, the company primarily provides key separation and purification materials for large-scale drug production, as well as separation and analysis chromatography columns and related instruments for drug quality testing and scientific research. In the field of flat panel displays, the company's main product is polymer spacer microspheres (spacer plastic balls) used to control the thickness of LCD panel boxes. The company also provides other optoelectronic microsphere materials, including silica-based spacer microspheres (spacer silica balls), conductive gold balls, standard particles, and black balls. These materials are used in various optical and electronic applications. The black balls can be used in car displays. It is worth noting that ""chromatography media"" has two Chinese translations: ""色谱填料"" and ""层析介质"". In the field of separation and purification of biomacromolecules, ""层析介质"" is commonly used, while in the field of separation and purification and analysis testing of small molecules, ""色谱填料"" is commonly used. In the biopharmaceutical field, the separation and purification process of drugs is closely related to drug quality and is a major component of drug production costs. The chromatography media and chromatography columns are essential for drug separation, purification, and quality testing. Chromatography can be divided into preparative chromatography and analytical chromatography. Preparative chromatography is used for large-scale separation and purification in the pharmaceutical industry, and pharmaceutical companies usually directly purchase chromatography media for this purpose. Analytical chromatography is used for laboratory analysis and testing, and laboratories usually require suppliers to pre-pack the media into columns for their use. The company's main products include various chromatography media for large-scale drug separation and purification, as well as chromatography columns and related instruments for drug quality testing and laboratory analysis. According to the ""Drug Registration Management Measures,"" the State Food and Drug Administration has established an evaluation and approval system for chemical raw materials, excipients, packaging materials, and containers related to direct contact drugs. When approving drug formulations, chemical raw materials are evaluated and approved together, as well as related excipients, packaging materials, and containers related to direct contact drugs. Since separation and purification is an important downstream production process in pharmaceutical manufacturing, according to relevant regulations such as the ""Technical Guidelines for Process Change Management in Biological Product Production,"" changes in separation and purification methods should undergo technical evaluation, verification, and appropriate clinical trials, including studying the biological changes of the main active ingredients before and after the change, analyzing the quality of three consecutive batches of products before and after the change, and conducting appropriate clinical trials. Therefore, pharmaceutical companies need to report the chromatography media manufacturer when their products are approved, and if they change suppliers, they need to test the products after the change, conduct trial production, testing, and go through the relevant change procedures with the drug regulatory authority. Customers have a strong preference for chromatography media and chromatography media suppliers. Chromatography/liquid chromatography is one of the most important and effective separation techniques in modern industry. Liquid chromatography uses a liquid as the mobile phase. When the mixture enters the column filled with chromatography media and flows to the other end of the column, the different components in the mixture have different interactions with the chromatography media, resulting in different migration rates in the column. This ultimately achieves the separation of the components. Chromatography technology is widely used in industrial separation and purification, including pharmaceutical manufacturing, food safety, environmental monitoring, materials, and petrochemicals. In the field of biopharmaceuticals, chromatography/liquid chromatography is almost the only means of separation and purification, and the production of high-purity and high-activity biopharmaceuticals relies heavily on chromatography/liquid chromatography. Chromatography columns are the heart of chromatography systems, and chromatography media are the core materials of chromatography columns. Therefore, chromatography columns and chromatography media are known as the ""core"" of chromatography. The performance of chromatography media depends on their morphology, structure, particle size and distribution, pore size and distribution, material composition, and surface functional groups. Different types of chromatography media require control of different parameters, making their production very challenging. For example, chromatography media used for industrial separation and purification often require particle sizes above 10 micrometers, while those used for analytical testing have particle sizes of 3 micrometers and 5 micrometers. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) requires media with particle sizes smaller than 2 micrometers. Chromatography media used for analytical testing are mainly silica-based, while those used for small molecule separation and purification include both silica-based and polymer-based media. On the other hand, the pore size of chromatography media also needs to be selected according to the size of the target molecule. Small molecules can be separated and purified using microspheres with small pore sizes and large specific surface areas, while large molecules require microspheres with large pore sizes. The improvement of chromatography performance comes from the improvement of the ability to control parameters such as media morphology, particle size, particle size distribution, pore structure, and specific surface area. Surface modification and functionalization of media are the basis for establishing chromatographic separation modes, and the nature, type, and density of functional groups on the surface of media can affect the selectivity of separation. By bonding different functional groups, chromatography media with different separation modes can be prepared. For example, bonding alkyl or phenyl functional groups can form reverse-phase chromatography media, bonding ion functional groups can prepare ion exchange chromatography media, and bonding affinity ligands can form affinity chromatography media. Chromatography media can be classified into two categories based on the matrix material: inorganic chromatography media and organic polymer chromatography media. Inorganic chromatography media, such as silica gel chromatography media, are the most common. Silica gel has advantages such as high mechanical strength, insolubility, controllable particle and pore sizes, and a surface rich in silanol groups (which can bond different functional groups). It is widely used in the separation and purification of small and medium-sized organic synthesis drugs, herbal medicines, chiral drugs, antibiotics, peptides, insulin, and other small molecules. In the field of analytical testing, chromatography columns packed with silica gel media account for 80% of the market share. However, silica gel chromatography media has limitations, such as easy detachment of the bonded phase under pH < 2 conditions and dissolution of silica gel at pH > 8, which restrict its use in separation and purification under acidic and alkaline conditions and shorten its lifespan. The remaining silanol groups on the surface of silica gel also result in poor separation of alkaline substances, affecting its application in the separation and analysis of alkaline compounds. Organic polymer chromatography media can overcome the limitations of silica gel chromatography media in acid and alkaline resistance and have complementary separation selectivity. Polymer matrices mainly include polystyrene and polyacrylic ester. Polystyrene matrices have hydrophobic functional groups (phenyl groups) and can be directly used as reverse-phase chromatography media without the need for hydrophobic groups such as alkyl chains to be bonded to the surface. The biggest advantage of polystyrene chromatography media is their strong chemical stability, heat resistance, acid and alkali resistance. They can work in the pH range of 1-14. Therefore, polystyrene chromatography media have the longest lifespan and best dirt resistance among all chromatography media/mediums and are one of the most durable materials. They can be regenerated by washing with strong acid or alkali solutions or organic solvents online, which is beneficial for the stability and repeatability of drug purification. Polyacrylic ester chromatography media have stronger polarity than polystyrene and are used for the separation and purification of medium to weakly polar compounds, such as lipophilic cellulose, steroidal compounds, and traditional Chinese medicine components. Polymer chromatography media can also be copolymerized with two or more different monomers (such as styrene and acrylic ester) to change their separation selectivity. Polymer-based media can also be modified and functionalized to prepare ion exchange, hydrophobic, size exclusion, and affinity chromatography media to meet the needs of large-scale separation and purification of biopharmaceuticals such as proteins, antibodies, vaccines, viruses, and blood products. Chromatography media can be classified into seven categories based on the chromatography separation mode and mechanism: reverse phase, normal phase, hydrophilic interaction, hydrophobic interaction, ion exchange, affinity, and size exclusion. Reverse phase chromatography separates most organic compounds, biomolecules, and small molecules based on the difference in the distribution coefficient of solutes between the mobile phase and the stationary phase due to their different hydrophobicity. Normal phase chromatography is a continuation of reverse phase chromatography into the hydrophilic mobile phase region. It separates compounds with strong polarity, weak to nonpolar compounds, such as lipophilic cellulose, steroidal compounds, and traditional Chinese medicine components. Hydrophilic interaction chromatography uses a polar stationary phase and a hydrophobic mobile phase. It separates highly polar, charged hydrophilic compounds, such as amino acids, monosaccharides, and polysaccharides. It is the opposite of reverse phase chromatography and is also known as hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). Hydrophobic interaction chromatography separates water-soluble biopolymers, such as proteins, antibodies, and vaccines, based on the weak hydrophobicity of solutes and their dependence on salt concentration. Ion exchange chromatography separates ionized or dissociated compounds, such as amino acids, peptides, proteins, insulin, antibodies, and nucleic acids, based on the differences in charge and the Coulombic interaction between solutes and ion exchange resins. Affinity chromatography separates molecules that interact specifically with the ligands on the stationary phase based on the specific interaction forces between solutes and the ligands. It is used for the separation and purification of molecules that interact specifically with the ligands, such as the separation and purification of antibodies using protein A affinity chromatography media. Size exclusion chromatography separates, desalts, and determines the molecular weight of biopolymers based on the difference in retention time of solutes in the porous media system due to the difference in molecular size and shape. Chromatography columns are mostly made of metal or glass and consist of column tubes, end caps, ferrules (sealing rings), sieves (filters), connectors, screws, etc. Chromatography columns used for industrial separation and purification are called preparative columns, those used for small-scale separation and purification of samples in the laboratory are called semi-preparative columns, and those used for laboratory analysis and testing are called analytical columns. The company produces optoelectronic microspheres in the field of flat panel displays. The main product is polymer spacer microspheres used to control the thickness of LCD panel boxes. The company also provides other optoelectronic microsphere materials, including silica-based spacer microspheres, conductive gold balls, black balls, and other special microspheres. Spacer microspheres are mainly used to support the upper and lower glass substrates and achieve precise control of the thickness of LCD panel boxes. They must meet high-quality and performance requirements, such as high particle size accuracy, narrow particle size distribution, excellent mechanical strength, smooth surface performance, high cleanliness, and low metal impurities. Therefore, the production technology has high barriers and has long relied on imports from Japan. Spacer microspheres are mainly solid spheres and include two types of matrix materials: polymer spacer microspheres (plastic balls) and silica spacer microspheres (silica balls). Plastic balls are mainly used for controlling the thickness of LCD panel boxes, while silica balls are mainly used for controlling the thickness of LCD panel frame boxes. In recent years, with the accelerated development of PDLC smart dimming films, new applications for plastic spacer balls have been opened up. The company's current optoelectronic microsphere products mainly consist of plastic spacer balls, and it can also provide silica spacer balls, conductive gold balls, black balls, and other special microspheres. Conductive gold balls are mainly produced by depositing nickel and gold metal layers on the surface of polymer microspheres. They are used in LCD frame boxes for electrical connection and are also important components of ACF anisotropic conductive adhesive films used in electronic packaging."	Intelligent manufacturing	'2.

After years of cultivation, the company has independently developed sapphire-based gallium nitride substrate material technology and cooperated with upstream and downstream companies in the industry to provide better comprehensive material solutions for the upgrading and development of the LED industry, contributing to the independent process of China's semiconductor industry. 2. Overview of the main products. The company's main products are 2 to 6-inch patterned sapphire substrates (PSS) and patterned composite material substrates (MMS). Patterned substrates are products that combine micrometer-level optical and material design with nanometer-level semiconductor process manufacturing. They serve as a link between sapphire materials and gallium nitride epitaxial chips. Based on different application requirements, LED chip-adapted substrates are manufactured through substrate materials, patterned structures, and periodic arrangements, providing high-quality substrate material solutions for LED chips in different application scenarios such as lighting, backlighting, displays, MiniLED, MicroLED, and UVCLED. In the early 1990s, Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano, and Shuji Nakamura invented the ""high-efficiency blue light-emitting diode,"" which allowed manufacturers to produce three-color (red, green, blue) LEDs. As a result, they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2014. Since the advent of high-efficiency blue light-emitting diodes, the LED industry has experienced significant development, with the organic combination of substrate, epitaxy, chip, and packaging in the industry chain, opening up a wide range of applications for LEDs. The company's PSS and MMS products are substrate materials for blue and green LED chips, serving as the basic materials used in LED chip production. Conventional substrate materials mainly serve to support and improve the characteristics of thin films. For substrate materials for light-emitting devices, they also need to focus on improving electro-optical conversion and light quantum efficiency, as well as light distribution design, while considering reliability and lifespan requirements. The patterned array on the substrate provides regular nucleation centers, promotes the growth of gallium nitride buffer layers, helps reduce dislocation density, adjust film stress, and improve crystal quality. Additionally, the interface layer formed by the three-dimensional patterned structure and gallium nitride material can effectively enhance light extraction efficiency and improve light propagation paths. (1) Patterned Sapphire Substrate (PSS). Patterned Sapphire Substrate (PSS) refers to a substrate with periodic micro or sub-micron structure patterns created on the surface of a sapphire wafer through semiconductor processes such as photolithography and etching. The advantages of PSS as an LED substrate material include: 1) Improving the crystal quality of GaN and reducing the dislocation density of LED epitaxial layers. The PSS surface has periodic patterns, which, compared to a flat sapphire substrate, provide a relatively ordered and controllable growth environment for materials, allowing for the bending and suppression of dislocations during material growth, significantly reducing dislocation density. When the GaN layer grows to a certain height, the adjacent patterns gradually merge, eventually fully covering the patterns and forming a complete and uniform GaN buffer layer, thereby improving crystal quality and enhancing the internal quantum efficiency of LED chips. In addition, PSS helps reduce the mismatch stress between gallium nitride and sapphire substrates, further improving epitaxial quality. 2) Increasing the light extraction efficiency of LEDs. One of the key obstacles to improving the light extraction efficiency of LEDs is the total internal reflection caused by the refractive index difference between GaN and free space. A large amount of light generated in the GaN active layer is reflected and trapped inside the chip, unable to escape, and eventually converted into heat or lattice vibrations. When PSS is used as the GaN-based LED epitaxial substrate, the surface patterns significantly increase the contact interface between GaN and sapphire, and the angled pattern design reduces the occurrence of total internal reflection, allowing more photons to escape, thereby improving the light extraction efficiency of LED chips. 3) Improving the spatial distribution of LED chip light intensity. The light intensity of an LED chip represents its light output strength in a certain direction. The light emitted by an LED chip has different intensities at different spatial angles. After the PSS is used to fabricate LED chips, the optimization of light intensity distribution characteristics can be achieved. In specific LED application scenarios that require higher light efficiency and light directionality, LED chip performance and light quality can be further optimized through different LED technology designs in terms of light flux, light intensity distribution, and color consistency. (2) Multi-Material Substrate (MMS). Multi-Material Substrate (MMS) refers to a new type of composite material substrate with periodic microstructures formed by adding composite material layers such as AlN, SiO2, and SiC on a sapphire substrate and performing semiconductor processes such as photolithography and etching. The company's current MMS products are composed of SiO2 and Al2O3, which are deposited on a sapphire wafer to form a patterned composite material substrate. By controlling the proportion of composite materials and designing the pattern structure and optics, MMS can change the spatial distribution of LED light emission, resulting in stronger axial light emission. In specific LED application scenarios that require higher light efficiency and light directionality, MMS has certain advantages compared to PSS in terms of changing the spatial distribution of light emission."

In the field of molecular biological reagents, the company has significant competitive advantages. Nobel laureate Arthur Kornberg once said, ""For life, there is no substance as important as enzymes in nature. DNA itself is lifeless, its language is cold and majestic, and enzymes are what truly give cells life and personality."" Enzymes, as core raw materials in the life science industry, can promote chemical reactions in organisms to proceed efficiently and specifically even under mild conditions. They have broad applications in basic research, in vitro diagnostics, gene sequencing, pharmaceutical research and development, vaccine production, animal quarantine, and forensic identification. Enzymes are proteins or ribonucleic acids synthesized by living cells that catalyze specific substrates with high efficiency, generally 107 to 1013 times higher than inorganic catalysts. In recent years, with the rapid development of life science technology, naturally occurring enzymes produced during species evolution can no longer meet the demands of ever-changing scientific research and increasingly diverse industrial applications. The scientific and industrial communities have begun to attempt to modify and screen natural enzymes through genetic engineering, enzyme engineering, cell engineering, and other artificial methods to obtain enzymes with higher catalytic efficiency and more stable performance. The company has completed the modification and evolution of more than 130 high-end molecular enzymes through its independently developed bidirectional molecular enzyme rational design and directed evolution platform. Each enzyme includes several different gene mutants, each with different characteristics and functions to adapt to different application scenarios. Currently, the company has achieved large-scale stable production and industrial application of more than 300 high-end molecular enzymes. For example, the sensitivity of natural Taq DNA polymerase for amplification is approximately 500 copies/ml. The Taq DNA polymerase prepared by the company through rational design and directed evolution technology has increased the sensitivity to 200 copies/ml and reduced the PCR amplification time from the original 2 hours to about 30 minutes. In the field of protein biological reagents, the company has mastered the three mainstream monoclonal antibody preparation technologies: hybridoma technology, phage display antibody library technology, and single B cell antibody preparation technology. The company's phage display antibody library technology has a capacity of 1.5×1010, which is of great significance for screening antibodies with higher affinity and shortening the antibody development cycle. The company's self-developed hot-start Taq DNA polymerase dual-blocking antibody has excellent performance. It can simultaneously block the activity of polymerase and exonuclease at low temperatures, effectively avoiding non-specific amplification. It can release more than 95% of the enzyme activity after heating at 95°C for 20 seconds. Each milligram of antibody can block 4,000 to 10,000 units of Taq enzyme. In the field of cell biological reagents, the domestic market is currently dominated by three major importers: Thermo Fisher, Danaher, and Merck. The domestic cell reagent market has long relied on imports, which has greatly affected the independent controllability of China's biopharmaceutical industry. Cell-based biological reagents are indispensable raw materials in the production process of biological products and one of the key factors affecting the research and commercialization of biopharmaceuticals. Based on the research and production experience of molecular and protein biological reagents, the company continues to invest in research and development in the development, process optimization, and technical accumulation of cell-based biological reagents.

The company's main services and products include: 1) Crystal form research and development services: The company provides professional crystal form research and development services to various types of pharmaceutical companies, including comprehensive crystal form research and solid-state testing services. The comprehensive crystal form research and development services include crystal form screening and evaluation, solid-state characterization and evaluation, crystallization process development, preclinical formulation development, and formulation feasibility evaluation. The company develops customized systematic research for client projects. For crystal form screening and evaluation, the company formulates targeted strategies based on the different stages and needs of client drug development, including polymorph, salt, and co-crystal screening and evaluation. For drug molecules that meet the development requirements in terms of solubility and bioavailability, the company generally conducts polymorph screening to recommend the development of thermodynamically stable crystal forms through scientific experimental design with limited sample and experimental quantities. For poorly soluble compounds, the company mainly uses salt or co-crystal screening and evaluation to select salt or co-crystal forms that meet the requirements of solubility, physical and chemical stability, and hygroscopicity for drug development. The focus of crystal form screening and evaluation varies depending on the different stages of drug development. When innovative drug development enters the lead compound optimization stage, the company usually conducts preliminary crystal form research on lead compounds to determine the crystal form and preliminary physical and chemical properties of compounds in early formulations for preclinical animal experiments. After the candidate compound is determined, systematic crystal form screening and evaluation are conducted to select the best solid form of the compound for further development. When the compound enters phase II clinical trials, the company reevaluates the selected crystal form to determine if it meets the requirements of late-stage clinical trials and post-marketing, as well as potential risks. The evaluation mainly focuses on stability, bioavailability, and processability, and a decision is made based on a balance of pros and cons. Before the drug is marketed, the company can conduct a final systematic and comprehensive crystal form screening to discover all possible polymorphs, salts, or co-crystals of the compound and establish comprehensive patent barriers to help clients extend the drug's lifecycle and market exclusivity. Solid-state characterization and evaluation involve comprehensive characterization and evaluation of the advantages crystal forms selected through crystal form screening and evaluation. This includes characterization and evaluation of physical and chemical properties, qualitative and quantitative analysis of crystal forms, and single crystal cultivation and structure analysis. The characterization and evaluation of physical and chemical properties include solubility, stability, hygroscopicity, flowability, crystallinity, and melting point. Common solid-state characterization methods used by the company include X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and dynamic vapor sorption analysis. Depending on the characteristics, types, and complexity of different drug polymorphs, multiple characterization methods are used in combination to achieve a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the physical and chemical properties of crystal forms. Qualitative and quantitative detection of crystal forms is an important means to identify and determine different crystal forms in drugs and to control the crystal form quality of raw materials and formulations. It can be used to analyze and determine whether the crystal form is consistent and stable during the process of raw material and formulation development, production, quality research, and storage. Single crystal cultivation and structure analysis are the main means to determine the absolute configuration of drug molecules and identify crystal form properties. This information needs to be reflected in drug registration application materials. Single crystals refer to crystal samples with a single continuous lattice, where the overall crystal is composed of the same spatial grid in three-dimensional directions, and the arrangement of particles in the crystal is long-range ordered. Single crystals usually have regular geometric shapes, are transparent, and have no bubbles, cracks, or impurities. Single crystal analysis provides crystal structure information that can clearly distinguish new crystal forms from existing ones, supporting the development of innovative crystal forms. Crystallization process development is a systematic engineering based on a comprehensive understanding of the physical and chemical properties of the target crystal form and its transformation relationship with other related crystal forms. By selecting suitable crystallization systems and methods and using online monitoring devices, selective crystallization of the target crystal form can be effectively controlled, ensuring that particle properties, yield, purity, solvent residue, and other indicators meet the requirements, while considering environmental protection, cost, and compatibility with customer factory equipment. After determining the appropriate drug crystal form, the company develops a crystallization process suitable for large-scale production and coordinates it with the synthesis process, transferring the relevant technology to the raw material drug factory for industrial production. Crystallization process development is also an important means for drug purification, chiral drug separation, and control of raw material particle properties. Preclinical formulation development: The company develops different preclinical formulations based on the different preclinical animal experiment needs of clients, such as pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics experiments, and preclinical safety evaluation experiments. The formulations, including solutions, emulsions, and suspensions, are developed based on the physical and chemical properties, solubility, and stability of the drug crystal form, ensuring the stability of the crystal form in the formulation and storage conditions. For poorly soluble drugs, technologies such as amorphous solid dispersion formulations, lipid emulsions, and nano-crystal formulations can be used to improve their drugability. Formulation feasibility evaluation of crystal forms: The final drug substance will be used for formulation development. To ensure the feasibility of the crystal form in the formulation process, the company tests the particle properties, processability, physical/chemical stability, solubility, and dissolution rate of the crystal form. Through studies on excipient compatibility and formulation stability, the formulation development risks of the crystal form are comprehensively evaluated, guiding the subsequent formulation process development and forming control strategies. In summary, the different modules of comprehensive crystal form research and development services are complementary and indispensable in drug development. When a compound initiates crystal form research, the company first obtains various crystal forms through crystal form screening and evaluation and selects the advantageous crystal forms. Then, through solid-state characterization and evaluation, in-depth research is conducted on the physical and chemical properties, crystal purity, crystal type, and crystal structure of the advantageous crystal forms. Next, by developing a crystallization process suitable for the advantageous crystal forms, qualified raw materials are obtained. Qualified raw materials can be used for preclinical formulation development to meet the needs of preclinical animal experiments. Further evaluation of the formulation feasibility of the crystal form is conducted to guide subsequent formulation development. For the development of innovative drugs, crystal form research can start in the lead compound optimization stage and generally covers all stages of innovative drug development. The company's comprehensive crystal form research services are positioned in the innovative drug development process as shown in the figure. For generic drug development, the company's crystal form research services mainly focus on pharmaceutical research and production stages. Through services such as drug solid-state characterization and evaluation, crystallization process development, and formulation feasibility evaluation of crystal forms, the company helps generic drug clients comprehensively evaluate the properties and developability of selected crystal forms, ensuring the stable production of qualified target crystal form products and ensuring the consistency of generic drug quality and efficacy. Solid-state testing services mainly include X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic vapor sorption analysis (DVS), and other tests. These tests can meet the needs of pharmaceutical sample characterization in one or more solid-state characterization methods during the development process, with the characteristics of rapid response and standardized testing. In addition to providing crystal form research services and conducting innovative crystal form technology and product development, the company also utilizes its pharmaceutical research and formulation development platform to provide pharmaceutical research and development services such as raw material drug chemical process research, formulation process development, and product quality research."

288	Kun Teng Microelectronics Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft)	High-end equipment	"Since its establishment, the company has been committed to the research and application of analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog signal conversion technology. With this technology as the core, on one hand, the company applies analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog signal conversion technology to the audio field. The company's audio SoC chips integrate high-performance audio ADC/DAC modules, achieving low-latency and high-fidelity audio transmission, forming one of the main competitive advantages of the company's audio SoC chips. On the other hand, the company has launched signal chain chip products for 4G/5G base stations, optical communications, industrial control, and other fields. These fields have high requirements for the performance and reliability of data converters, requiring high-speed or high-precision data conversion indicators.The main function of audio chips is to transmit, process, and receive audio signals. The company's audio SoC chips are system-level chips that integrate multiple modules or components, algorithms, and software into a single chip, forming a miniature system to achieve complete system functionality. SoC chips effectively combine complex circuits and software to achieve complete functionality, requiring high requirements for research and development design, manufacturing processes, and hardware and software co-development technology. Compared to traditional discrete device solutions, SoC chips have obvious advantages in performance and power consumption, gradually occupying a dominant position in the terminal device chip market.The company's audio SoC chips have the characteristics of high integration, mainly including wireless audio transmission chips, wireless microphones, speakers, home KTV systems, radios, recorders, and all-in-one machines.

Compared to traditional wireless sound transmission system solutions, this series of chips can significantly reduce the number of components in the entire terminal electronic system, reduce production difficulties, and make terminal electronic products easier to achieve miniaturization and portability. The company's FM/AM transceiver chips are fully integrated single-chip solutions with features such as no debugging, high integration, excellent sensitivity, and strong anti-interference ability. They are mainly used in electronic products such as radios and recorders. The company entered this field early and launched a digital FM transmitter in 2007, winning the ""China Semiconductor Innovation Product and Technology Award"" selected by the China Semiconductor Industry Association that year.

With the gradual popularization of the USB Type-C interface in terminal smart electronic products, the company's USB audio chips are widely used in fields such as Type-C headphones and Type-C audio converters.2. Signal chain chips. Signal chain chips are analog chips used in the path from signal input to output in a system, responsible for signal acquisition, amplification, transmission, and processing, including amplifiers, comparators, data converters, and non-power management analog devices. Signal chain chip technology has high barriers and high product standardization, with few domestic companies in this field. Currently, the company's signal chain chip products are all data converters, including analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-analog converters, and integrated data converters.1) Basic concept of data converters. Analog signals can only be processed by software after being converted into digital signals, and the conversion process requires data converters. The counterpart of analog-to-digital conversion is digital-to-analog conversion, which is the inverse process of analog-to-digital conversion. Data converters are the bridge between analog signals in the real world and digital signals, and are the foundation of digital signal technology development. Compared to analog circuits, digital circuits have advantages such as high integration, strong anti-interference, easy implementation, and low cost. Therefore, digital circuits are often used to replace analog circuits to complete signal processing. However, most signals in reality are analog signals, such as temperature, sound, images, and pressure, so data converters are needed to process signal conversion. Data converters mainly consider two basic indicators, conversion rate and conversion accuracy. The conversion rate is usually expressed in samples per second (sps), such as 1Msps and 1Gsps, corresponding to data converter sampling rates of 1 million times and 1 billion times per second, respectively. The conversion accuracy is usually expressed in resolution (bits), and a higher resolution indicates a smaller difference between the converted digital/analog signal and the original signal. High-performance data converters need to have the ability to convert data at high speed or with high precision. The speed and accuracy indicators of data converters often have a trade-off relationship, where an increase in one may lead to a decrease in the other. For example, the fastest commercial analog-to-digital converter currently available has a conversion rate of 26Gsps but only has a resolution of 3 bits, while an analog-to-digital converter with a resolution of 24 bits has a conversion rate of only 26Msps. Data converters are widely used in consumer electronics, communications, automotive electronics, industrial control, medical devices, and other fields. Compared to the consumer electronics market, the communication, automotive electronics, industrial control, and medical device fields have higher requirements for the performance and reliability of data converters. Currently, driven by factors such as the construction of 5G communications, the growth of mobile communication terminals and portable mobile Internet devices, the communication field has become one of the main application markets for data converters. In terms of technology and market aspects of data converters, international well-known analog IC companies such as Analog Devices and Texas Instruments are leading, occupying the high-end and mid-to-high-end markets. In terms of research and development and technology of data converters, domestic companies started relatively late and have a large gap compared to the international advanced level, especially in the field of high-speed and high-precision data converters. With the advancement of domestic 5G construction and strong support from national industrial policies, 5G has become an important opportunity for domestic manufacturers in the application of high-performance data converters.2) Introduction to the company's data converter products. The company is one of the few domestic enterprises that master high-performance analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog conversion technology and commercialize it. The company has product categories such as analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-analog converters, and integrated data converters. According to the conversion speed/accuracy indicators of data converter products, they can be further divided into high-speed or precision products. The company has a relatively complete series of data converter products, covering various models such as high-speed/precision and single-channel/multi-channel, which can meet the needs of different application scenarios. This series of products is mainly used in 4G/5G base stations, optical communications, industrial control, and other fields. The typical application scenario of data converters is that analog-to-digital converters measure the characteristic signals (voltage, current, temperature, etc.) of controlled devices and convert them into digital signals to be transmitted to processing chips.

323	Shanghai Fuye Environmental Protection Technology Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft for Review)	High-end equipment	"The company's main products are low-temperature vacuum dehydration and drying integrated technology equipment, waste gas purification technology equipment. The business covers the design, customized production, on-site integration, installation and commissioning of technical equipment, as well as the sales of related equipment and accessories, operation and maintenance services, etc. 1. Low-temperature vacuum dehydration and drying integrated technology equipment. (1) Innovation in low-temperature vacuum dehydration and drying integrated technology. The equipment is an advanced environmental protection technology equipment developed by the company through years of continuous independent innovation and research and development. The equipment is mainly used for solid-liquid separation of difficult-to-treat materials such as sludge and materials with low filter cake moisture content. It can be widely used in municipal and industrial sludge dehydration and drying, as well as solid waste or special materials in industries such as petrochemical, coal, food, pharmaceutical, non-ferrous, and light industry. The company has overcome the two major technical problems of integrated sludge dehydration and drying process technology and equipment manufacturing, and has achieved the following two technological innovations: Technological innovation 1: By using the principle of reducing water boiling point with environmental pressure, the mechanical pressure filtration dehydration and vacuum drying technology are creatively integrated. The moisture content of sludge is reduced from 90-99% to below 30% at one time, greatly reducing the traditional thermal drying temperature (reducing the temperature from above 100°C to below 90°C), vaporization temperature (reducing the temperature from 100°C to about 45°C), and energy consumption of the entire dehydration and drying process (energy saving of more than 15%). It realizes efficient sludge dehydration, low-temperature drying, and process energy saving. Technological innovation 2: In terms of the production and manufacturing technology of high-temperature drying filter plates, innovative development of the largest tonnage (greater than 60000KN) super large oil pressure filter plate molding equipment and super large capacity (greater than 350kg) online horizontal plastic injection compression molding process (Online-HPICM) in the industry. From feeding, molding, shaping to final processing and assembly, fully automatic programmatic production is realized. The drying filter plate integrates filtration, pressure filtration, vacuum extraction, heating, and drying functions. The temperature resistance is increased from the conventional 50°C to 120°C, with high mechanical strength, high thermal efficiency, good sealing performance, and strong tolerance to temperature changes, achieving complete replacement of imported customized products. Based on the above technological innovations, through the processes of filtration, pressure filtration, and low-temperature (<90°C) vacuum drying, the moisture in the filter cake is fully removed, and the moisture content is reduced from 90-99% to below 30%. The volume and weight of the sludge are greatly reduced, and the resulting treated products can be connected to various subsequent disposal methods. (2) Technical advantages of low-temperature vacuum dehydration and drying integrated technology equipment. Compared with the traditional two-stage process of sludge dehydration and drying (the first stage uses belt filter press, centrifuge, or plate and frame filter press, and the second stage uses paddle, disc, fluidized bed, or belt dryer), the equipment has the following advantages: Comparison diagram of two-stage sludge dehydration and drying and low-temperature vacuum ""integrated"" process. Taking the original sludge with a water content of 99% and a weight of 1000kg as an example, after conventional mechanical dewatering, the water content can be reduced to 80%, corresponding to a weight of 50kg; after integrated dewatering and drying treatment, the water content can be reduced to 30%, corresponding to a weight of only 14.3kg. Therefore, the sludge after dewatering and drying treatment achieves a reduction of more than 98% compared to the original sludge with a water content of 99%, and a reduction of more than 70% compared to the sludge with a water content of 80%. Filling the gap of integrated dewatering and drying: Creatively integrating mechanical pressure filtration dehydration and vacuum drying technology to achieve efficient sludge dehydration, low-temperature drying, and process energy saving, filling the gap in integrated dewatering and drying technology for sludge treatment at home and abroad (Invention Patent: Low-temperature vacuum dehydration and drying complete set of equipment and process ZL201210045436.3). International advanced level of core component manufacturing: The core component of low-temperature vacuum dehydration and drying integrated technology equipment, the high-temperature drying filter plate, has stable and reliable performance, and multiple technical indicators exceed imported customized products, meeting the strict requirements of mechanical strength, heat transfer efficiency, sealing performance, and temperature resistance in the dewatering and drying process. Participation in multiple industry and group standards: The company has participated in the compilation of multiple industry and group standards, including the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development's ""Technical Standards for Sludge Treatment in Urban Sewage Treatment Plants,"" the National Sludge Alliance's ""Common Sludge Drying Equipment,"" ""Sludge Drying Equipment Product Quality Testing,"" the China General Machinery Industry Association's ""Box and Plate Frame Filter Press,"" and ""Box and Plate Frame Filter Press Filter Plate,"" among others. Multiple effects in sludge treatment: The low-temperature vacuum dehydration and drying integrated technology equipment can reduce the water content of sludge from 90-99% to below 30% at one time, and can be flexibly adjusted between 10-60% water content. It not only achieves maximum reduction of sludge, but also integrates sludge dewatering, drying, sterilization, deodorization, and granulation, achieving multiple effects in one. Adaptation to diversified disposal routes: The products obtained after sludge treatment with low-temperature vacuum dehydration and drying integrated technology equipment have been sterilized, greatly reducing environmental risks. They are suitable for various subsequent sludge disposal methods, such as land use, landscaping, sanitary landfill, incineration, building material utilization, and mine restoration. They can be used for resource utilization or safe disposal according to the characteristics of different sludge and the requirements of national and local environmental protection policies. Low safety hazards: Traditional thermal drying of sludge under atmospheric conditions (drying temperature > 100°C) has safety hazards such as dust explosion and large exhaust gas emissions. The low-temperature vacuum dehydration and drying process uses 85-90°C hot water as the heating medium, and the dehydration and drying process operates in a fully enclosed negative pressure environment. After the sludge enters the dehydration and drying system, it no longer has dynamic contact with other operating components, eliminating the risk of wear and dust explosion. The entire equipment is also equipped with system failure alarms and emergency stop devices to ensure the safety of equipment and personnel. Low dosage of chemicals, conducive to subsequent disposal: In the stage of chemical conditioning and conditioning, the low-temperature vacuum dehydration and drying process only adds a small amount of conventional flocculants such as PAM, without the need for additional additives. The dosage of chemicals is low. Compared with the deep dewatering of traditional sludge, which requires the addition of a large amount of inorganic coagulants for conditioning, the dry basis of the sludge does not increase, achieving full reduction of the sludge and reducing the restrictions and environmental risks of sludge disposal routes. Sludge reduction and harmlessness: Compared with traditional sludge dewatering processes, the low-temperature vacuum dehydration and drying integrated technology equipment achieves a reduction of more than 70% in sludge volume and weight by reducing the water content from 90-99% to below 30%. In the process of dewatering and drying, the sludge is also partially harmless. It can be disposed of in a safe and resourceful manner according to local conditions, such as low-quality fuel, raw materials for building materials, and soil for landscaping. Large energy-saving and consumption reduction: Traditional sludge drying equipment usually uses drying temperatures above 100°C, resulting in high energy consumption and operating costs. The low-temperature vacuum dehydration and drying integrated process technology uses 85-90°C hot water as the heating medium, which is safer and more economical than direct use of high-pressure steam, saving more than 15% energy. It can also choose flue gas, hot water, sewage source heat pump, or low-grade waste steam as heat sources according to actual conditions, further saving operating energy consumption and reducing treatment costs. The application of advanced sewage source heat pump technology will also promote the resource utilization and energy utilization of sewage. Simultaneous treatment of sludge, water, and gas: The low-temperature vacuum dehydration and drying integrated technology equipment achieves efficient dewatering and drying of sludge through high integration. In particular, in the vacuum drying stage, the vaporization temperature of water in the sludge is greatly reduced from 100°C under atmospheric conditions to about 45°C. Compared with traditional thermal drying processes, it only produces a small amount of low-boiling-point VOCs gas, with low odor and small gas volume, which greatly reduces the concentration of pollutants in the process gas and drying condensate, making it easy to collect and treat in subsequent processes. At the same time, in order to meet the strictest emission standards for exhaust gas, the integrated technology equipment adopts measures such as airflow simulation, mainframe sealing, efficient exhaust gas collection, composite exhaust gas purification, and ion air supply, greatly improving the operating environment of the sludge workshop. The entire dewatering and drying process is leak-free, and all filtrate is returned to the sewage treatment plant, achieving simultaneous treatment of sludge, water, and gas. Fully automated dewatering and drying process: The sludge dewatering and drying process realizes fully automated integrated control, and all operating states and parameters are displayed in real time on the industrial control computer. The system has a simple structure, convenient operation, and does not require manual intervention during operation, with low labor intensity and simple maintenance. Fully automated unloading, conveying, and transportation: Through the configuration of unloading, conveying, and transportation systems including screw conveyors, automatic docking mechanisms, sludge transfer boxes, and electric flatbed turntables, the unloading, conveying, transportation, and loading of the sludge after dewatering and drying are fully automated, with no dust or odor emissions throughout the process. Industrial Internet intelligent operation and maintenance: Based on the actual application cases of nearly 100 sets of sludge dewatering and drying technology equipment distributed throughout the country, the company has independently developed and built the ""Environmental Equipment Intelligent Operation and Maintenance Service Management System (SOMS) based on the Internet of Things"" based on the concept of the Internet of Things, providing customers with a full life cycle and all-round supervision and maintenance system solutions. The low-temperature vacuum dehydration and drying integrated technology has been applied in various projects, including the Shanghai Taihe Sewage Treatment Plant, Shanghai Hongqiao Sewage Treatment Plant, Guangzhou Daguan Sewage Treatment Plant, Jianggao Sewage Treatment Plant, Shijing Sewage Treatment Plant, and many other large-scale underground sewage treatment plants. The technology has also been applied in industrial projects such as Shengke Water, Shengdie Semiconductor, Hehui Optoelectronics, and Yutong Bus, achieving significant environmental and economic benefits. In the field of waste gas purification, the company has a series of waste gas purification technologies and complete sets of equipment, including active oxygen ion purification technology, composite compound purification technology, biofilter purification technology, biofilter-based compound waste gas purification technology, molecular capture catalytic oxidation technology, etc. These technologies have strong control capabilities over the entire process of ""enclosure-collection-transportation-treatment-emission"" of waste gas treatment. The company's waste gas purification business mainly targets the purification needs of odorous pollutants and volatile organic pollutants in the field of water pollution control, including sewage treatment, sludge treatment, and pumping stations.

360	Shanghai Hesai Technology Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft)	High-end equipment	During the reporting period, the company's laser radar products mainly consisted of mechanical rotating and semi-solid-state laser radars based on time-of-flight ranging. Mechanical rotating laser radar products have been widely used in the field of unmanned driving, while semi-solid-state laser radars are mainly targeted at the emerging mass production passenger vehicle advanced driver assistance market. Based on the prediction of the future market, the company has also carried out technical layout and accumulation of FMCW laser radar and electronic scanning solutions, and has the capability to develop laser radar products with new technical solutions. Overall, the differences in various application areas have put forward different requirements for the comprehensive indicators of laser radar, and product performance stratification and coexistence of different architectural solutions will be the norm. Laser radar can be divided into time-of-flight (ToF) ranging method, frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) ranging method based on coherent detection, and triangulation ranging method, among which ToF and FMCW can achieve long-range measurement (100~250m) under outdoor sunlight and are the preferred solutions for automotive laser radar. ToF is currently the mainstream solution for medium and long-range automotive laser radar in the market, and in the future, with the maturity of FMCW laser radar as a whole and the upstream industry chain, ToF and FMCW laser radar will coexist in the market. By directly measuring the time difference between the emitted laser and the echo signal and based on the propagation speed of light in the air, the distance information of the target object is obtained, which has the advantages of fast response speed and high detection accuracy. By linearly modulating the optical frequency of the emitted laser and obtaining the frequency difference through coherent beat frequency with the echo signal and the reference light, the flight time can be indirectly deduced to obtain the distance of the target object. FMCW laser radar has the advantages of directly measuring velocity information and anti-interference (including ambient light and other laser radars). ToF laser radar system mainly includes the transmission module, reception module, control and signal processing module, and scanning module (if any). Figure: Schematic diagram of the core module of ToF laser radar. According to the technical architecture, it can be divided into overall rotating mechanical laser radar, semi-solid-state laser radar with stationary transceiver module, and solid-state laser radar. The overall rotating mechanical laser radar is driven by a motor to rotate the transceiver array as a whole, realizing a 360° horizontal field of view scan of the spatial range. The ranging capability remains consistent within the 360° horizontal field of view. The characteristic of the semi-solid-state solution is the decoupling of the transceiver unit from the scanning component, and the transceiver unit (such as laser and detector) no longer performs mechanical motion, including micro-mirror and rotating mirror solutions, etc. It is suitable for detecting partial field of view angles (such as forward), and its volume is more compact than that of mechanical rotating radar. The characteristic of the solid-state solution is that it no longer contains any mechanical moving parts, including optical phased array (OPA) solutions, flash solutions, electronic scanning solutions, etc. It is suitable for detecting partial field of view angles (such as forward), and because it does not contain mechanical scanning devices, its volume is the most compact compared to other architectures. Compared with semi-solid-state and solid-state laser radars, the advantage of mechanical rotating laser radar is that it can perform a 360° horizontal field of view scan of the surrounding environment, while semi-solid-state and solid-state laser radars can only achieve a maximum of 120° horizontal field of view scan, and the ranging capability within the field of view is less uniform than that of mechanical rotating laser radar. The operating environment of unmanned driving vehicles is complex, and it requires equal perception ability of the surrounding 360° environment. Due to the advantages of 360° horizontal field of view angle and long-range ranging capability, mechanical rotating laser radar has been widely used as the main perception sensor in mainstream unmanned driving projects. Combining its own technical characteristics, industry cycle, and market demand, the company has taken the field of unmanned driving as the entry point for laser radar products, and the revenue-generating products during the reporting period mainly come from this market. In addition to unmanned driving, the fields of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) for passenger vehicles, service robots, and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) are also important markets for laser radar currently or in the near future. Because the usage scenarios and carriers carrying laser radar (unmanned driving vehicles, passenger vehicles, robots, etc.) have obvious differences, these markets have different requirements for the performance, price, and size of laser radar. The comparison results are shown in the table below. The application of vehicle networking has just started, and the usage scenarios are diverse, which will have corresponding demands for laser radar in unmanned driving, advanced driver assistance, and robot fields. Medium (L2/L3, limited application scenarios with enabled functions). Low/Medium (closed parks, more applications). High (urban roads, fewer applications). Low (closed parks). High (high-speed scenarios). High (high-speed scenarios). Medium/Long (depending on ADAS functions). Medium/Long (depending on application scenarios). Integration degree with the appearance of the carrier*. Degree of algorithm requirements for laser radar suppliers. Medium (current)/High (expected). *Often reflected by appearance volume and shape. The field of unmanned driving and advanced driver assistance systems usually classify autonomous driving technology according to the engineering recommendations J3016 issued by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE International). From Level L0 (fully driver-controlled) to Level L5 (fully autonomous driving), the higher the level, the higher the vehicle's degree of automation, and the lower the driver's involvement in the dynamic driving process, the stronger the dependence on the environmental perception system composed of vehicle-mounted sensors. Level L3 is a watershed in the level of autonomous driving, and the definition of driving responsibility is the most complex: in the scenario where the autonomous driving function is enabled, the environmental monitoring subject changes from the driver to the sensor system, and the driving decision responsibility transitions from the driver to the vehicle system. Currently, Level L2 autonomous driving perception systems are mainly composed of ultrasonic radar, millimeter-wave radar, cameras, and other vehicle-mounted sensors. Vehicle-mounted ultrasonic radar has low cost but the effective detection distance is usually less than 5m, which cannot measure medium and long-range objects; millimeter-wave radar has the function of simultaneous ranging and speed measurement, and the effective detection distance can reach 200m, but the angle resolution of a single vehicle-mounted millimeter-wave radar is usually weak. For example, the optimal horizontal angular resolution of the Continental (Conti) 77GHz high-end millimeter-wave radar ARS408-21 is 1.6° in long-range mode, which cannot identify the details of objects, and the millimeter-wave radar has a higher sensitivity to metal than non-metal materials, resulting in poor detection of pedestrians in scenarios with mixed pedestrians and vehicles; cameras have excellent angular resolution, but they are greatly affected by lighting conditions, and the detection effect is poor in dark and strong light conditions. In addition, the recognition of objects and their distances by cameras depends on deep learning algorithms and cannot achieve complete accuracy. Laser radar has the advantages of long-range measurement, high angular resolution, and less affected by environmental lighting, and it does not require deep learning algorithms. It can directly obtain the distance and azimuth information of objects. These advantages compared to other sensors can significantly improve the reliability of autonomous driving systems, and therefore, they are considered by most vehicle manufacturers and Tier 1 companies as essential sensors for autonomous driving at Level L3 and above (when the function is enabled, the responsibility lies with the vehicle system). Level L4/L5 autonomous driving functions are usually defined as unmanned driving, and the driving responsibility belongs entirely to the vehicle system. Therefore, the detection performance requirements for laser radar are the highest. However, because the owners of the vehicles are often unmanned driving operation companies (Robotaxi/Robotruck), the requirements for the price and integration with the vehicle body of laser radar are relatively lower; Level L2/L3 autonomous driving functions are usually defined as advanced driver assistance, and the owners of the vehicles are individual consumers. They have higher requirements for the aesthetics of laser radar integrated with the vehicle body and are more price-sensitive. For non-automotive applications, the main characteristics of service robots are slow movement speed, low scene complexity, and relatively low requirements for the detection performance of laser radar, but they are more sensitive to price. Vehicle networking applications use advanced wireless communication and new-generation Internet technologies to implement comprehensive vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-road dynamic real-time information interaction, and carry out active safety control of vehicles and road coordination management based on dynamic traffic information collection and fusion. The main application scenarios include blind spot warning, multi-vehicle cooperative lane change, intersection conflict avoidance, pedestrian and non-motor vehicle collision avoidance, priority passage for emergency vehicles, speed guidance, convoy control, and convoy coordination through signalized intersections, etc. Effective coordination of people, vehicles, and roads requires accurate identification and tracking of traffic participants and effective prediction of their routes. The target clustering and tracking algorithms based on laser radar point cloud data can meet this requirement. The PandarMind series products can directly output the target recognition results processed by deep learning algorithms. Compared with the traditional solution of laser radar with external algorithm processing units, the internal integration of PandarMind algorithm has the advantage of not requiring additional software porting and deployment. In addition, compared with the typical time delay of ≥100ms required by traditional algorithm solutions, PandarMind effectively reduces the typical time delay, providing vehicles with longer response time for driving decisions, which is conducive to effective coordination of people, vehicles, and roads, ensuring traffic safety and improving traffic efficiency.

379	Jiangsu Pan-Asia Micropermeation Technology Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft)	High-end equipment	"(1) Basic information about the company's main business and main products. 1. Overview of the main business and development strategy (1) Overview of the company's main business The company is mainly engaged in the research, development, production, and sales of micro-porous materials such as expanded polytetrafluoroethylene film (ePTFE), as well as their modified derivative products, sealing components, and water-blocking films. It is a new material supplier and solution provider with independent research and development and innovation capabilities. Through the modification and composite of ePTFE film and other micro-porous materials, the company continuously develops customized component products with special characteristics such as sound, electricity, magnetism, heat, waterproof and breathable, gas management, weather resistance, and chemical resistance for customers. The company has the Jiangsu Province Expanded Polytetrafluoroethylene and Aerogel Composite Material Engineering Technology Research Center, and has a series of core technologies including mature ePTFE film manufacturing, modification, and composite. In addition, the company has led the formulation of the industry standard ""Waterproof and Breathable Components for Automotive Electrical and Electronic Equipment"" (QC/T979-2014), and the performance of the ePTFE film produced has reached an advanced level in the industry. The company's automotive micro-vent products have begun to challenge industry giants such as Gore and Nippon Electric in the domestic market and gradually achieve import substitution. So far, the company has developed ePTFE films and component products that can be applied in various fields, and has achieved sales revenue in the automotive, consumer electronics, packaging, and new energy fields. Sealing components and water-blocking films are traditional products of the company. Sealing components are mainly used in automotive doors, engines, car lights, and car air conditioners, with functions such as sealing, waterproofing, dustproofing, and shock absorption. The main customers include Xingyu Car Lights, SAIC Volkswagen, SAIC General Motors, and Huayu Vision, which are well-known OEMs or car light manufacturers. Water-blocking films are mainly used on the inner side of automotive door panels to protect the normal operation of the circuits inside the doors and prevent rainwater, dust, and other external substances from entering. The main customers include SAIC General Motors, SAIC Group, and BAIC Group, which are well-known OEMs. The company has excellent product design capabilities, and the mold drawings of water-blocking films designed for SAIC General Motors can be uploaded to the global system of General Motors for production by other General Motors manufacturers in other countries or regions. With excellent product performance and service capabilities, the company has won the ""Supplier Quality Excellence Award"" from General Motors multiple times, as well as the honorary title of ""Excellent Supplier"" from Xingyu Car Lights and Da Mao Weiruike Car Lights. The company's sound insulation products mainly include basic sound-absorbing cotton and ePTFE film composite sound-absorbing cotton, which are mainly used in automotive interiors to achieve sound absorption and noise reduction. The company's basic sound-absorbing cotton has good full-frequency sound absorption performance, and the sound absorption coefficient in the high-frequency range can reach above 0.95. The ePTFE film composite sound-absorbing cotton is an innovative product developed by the company. Compared with basic sound-absorbing cotton, this product has better sound absorption performance under the same weight, and can meet the requirements of Volkswagen's acoustic Class 1 (the highest level) and Audi's acoustic AUDI4 (the second highest level). Gas management products mainly include desiccants and defogging agents, which have a wide range of applications, but are currently mainly used in automotive headlights. The company's gas management products are mainly made of magnesium chloride, which has strong moisture absorption capacity. The maximum moisture absorption can reach more than 200% of its own weight, but the disadvantage is that it is difficult to overcome the problem of halogen return. Through formula improvement, the company can not only solve the halogen return problem of desiccants but also achieve reversible drying by absorbing infrared energy, thereby meeting the long-term repeated use requirements of customers for desiccants. At the same time, by combining the relevant technologies of ePTFE film and desiccants, the company has developed CMD products. CMD can systematically solve the condensation problem in small enclosed spaces, not only applicable to the field of car lights, replacing traditional anti-fog coating solutions but also applicable to emerging fields such as new energy power battery packs, new energy vehicle charging modules, and energy storage devices for 5G outdoor base stations, with good market prospects. Due to the non-standardized nature of the production equipment for ePTFE films and their component products, as well as the involvement of many technical secrets in the production process, most of the company's production equipment is independently designed or modified, and the independent design and modification capabilities of production equipment constitute an important technological barrier for the company. While producing its own equipment, the company also sells precision die-cutting machines, precision coating machines, and other equipment to the outside world, which are mainly used in the medical and manufacturing industries. Based on the different growth rates, gross profit margin levels, and the proportion of operating income, the company's main business can be divided into two categories: high-growth business and stable development business. High-growth business includes consumer electronics micro-vent products, gas management products, and CMD, which have high growth rates. The compound annual growth rate of revenue during the reporting period was 135.41%, with high gross profit margin levels. The average gross profit margin during the reporting period was 81.39%, 82.44%, and 78.45%, respectively. However, the current proportion of operating income is not high. During the reporting period, the revenue proportion was 3.32%, 8.28%, and 13.84%, respectively, which belongs to the company's future key expansion business areas. Stable development business includes automotive micro-vent products, packaging micro-vent products, sealing components, water-blocking films, sound insulation products, and mechanical equipment, which currently have stable growth rates and a relatively high proportion of operating income. Based on the existing technology, products, and market, the company will continue to maintain research and development investment, improve product performance, enrich product variety, continuously expand new application markets, and strive to become an enterprising, innovative, and diversified new material research and development enterprise and solution provider. 2.

The core material of the company's ePTFE micro-vent products is ePTFE film, which is a micro-porous film formed by stretching PTFE after expansion. There are billions of micropores on every square centimeter of the film, with each micropore having a diameter of about 0.1-1.0μm, which is 1/20,000 the size of a water droplet and 700 times the size of an air molecule. Therefore, the film can prevent liquid water and dust from passing through while allowing air and water vapor to pass through, thus achieving the function of waterproof and breathable. Currently, the company's ePTFE micro-vent products are mainly used in the automotive, consumer electronics, and packaging industries. 1. Breathable plugs, breathable films. Breathable plugs and breathable film products are mainly used in automotive headlights (main headlights, fog lights, taillights, high-level brake lights), wiper motors, ECUs, etc. During the operation of automotive headlights, light emission, motor operation, and ECU operation generate a large amount of heat, which increases the internal air pressure of the equipment and forms a pressure difference between the inside and outside of the equipment. If the pressure difference cannot be eliminated in time, the stress generated inside the equipment will damage the sealing performance and allow external pollutants to enter the equipment, causing damage. Due to the waterproof and breathable characteristics of ePTFE film, it can ensure the circulation of gas between the inside and outside of the equipment, eliminate the internal and external pressure difference, and prevent external liquid water, dust, pollutants, etc. from entering the equipment, causing failure of sensitive electronic components. Currently, breathable plugs and breathable film products have achieved import substitution and established stable cooperative relationships with domestic and foreign well-known car light manufacturers. The main customers of this product include Huayu Vision, Valeo, Xingyu car lights, Liangwang car lights, and other domestic and foreign well-known car light enterprises, covering well-known OEMs such as SAIC Volkswagen, SAIC General Motors, SAIC Group, FAW Toyota, Great Wall Motor, GAC Group, and Chery Automobile. The company has recently successfully expanded its cooperation with Stanray (Japanese car suppliers such as Toyota and Honda), Sanli car lights (Korean car suppliers such as Hyundai and Kia), and Hella car lights (German car suppliers such as Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz), marking the official entry of the company's breathable plugs and breathable film products into the supply chain of Japanese, Korean, and German high-end brand automobiles. 2. Waterproof and pressure-resistant sound-permeable film. In addition to being waterproof and breathable, the company's ePTFE film also has good sound-permeable performance. When sound waves contact one side of the ePTFE film, the film will vibrate and convert the energy carried by the sound waves into physical vibrations. The physical vibrations will cause air vibrations on the other side of the film, generating sound waves with similar frequencies, thereby achieving high-level sound transmission. The company's waterproof and pressure-resistant sound-permeable film is mainly installed in consumer electronics such as smartphones, watches, smart bracelets, cameras, etc., to seal gaps and slots in the devices, thereby achieving IP67 and IP68 waterproof and dustproof levels and maintaining optimal sound quality after passing through the waterproof film. The waterproof and dustproof performance is a major trend in the development of consumer electronics. Since the launch of the iPhone 7, which improved the waterproof and dustproof performance to IP67 in 2016, Apple has extended the waterproof performance to its smartwatch product Apple Watch Series 2, further improving the waterproof performance to IP68. Since then, well-known domestic and foreign smart wearable device brands such as Fitbit, Samsung, and Huawei have followed suit. From January to June 2020, the issuer has received orders for Xiaomi and Huawei supply chains (including completed orders). The company's waterproof and pressure-resistant sound-permeable film products are also used in security monitoring, cameras, outdoor network devices, GPS navigation, and other fields. Among them, Dahua Technology (002236.SZ) is the company's major customer in the security field. Pressure relief valve products are mainly used in new energy power battery packs. When the battery pack is charged, discharged, and operated under different conditions, the internal battery cells generate a large amount of heat, causing the internal gas of the battery pack to expand. When the operation stops and the temperature decreases, the gas pressure inside the battery pack decreases. When the internal pressure of the box continues to rise and fall, the sealing reliability of the battery pack will be seriously affected. When the battery cells are thermally out of control, high temperature and high pressure can occur, posing a risk of severe combustion and explosion. Due to the waterproof, dustproof, and breathable characteristics of ePTFE film, it is an ideal material choice for making pressure relief valves. When the battery pack is operating normally, the pressure relief valve can continuously balance the internal and external pressure of the battery pack and prevent pollutants from the external environment from entering the battery pack. When the battery pack encounters special situations such as impact, which causes the internal gas pressure to rise rapidly, the pressure relief valve structure will open or directly break, quickly releasing the pressure inside the battery pack, preventing the battery pack from expanding violently or even exploding, and ensuring the safety of passengers in new energy vehicles. The new energy vehicle industry is a key industry encouraged by China. With the increasing penetration rate of new energy vehicles in the automotive market, battery safety issues have attracted more and more attention from society. Pressure relief valves play a crucial role in the safety of power battery packs, and the demand in the market has been steadily increasing in recent years. Currently, the company is actively expanding cooperation with high-end customers such as BMW Group and has obtained the supplier code of BMW Group. The company's packaging protection gasket products are mainly used in the packaging and transportation of chemicals and liquid organic fertilizers. Chemicals and organic fertilizers have strong corrosiveness and volatility. During transportation, sunlight and vibration can generate a large amount of volatile gas, causing the packaging container to rupture and leak due to increased internal pressure. Therefore, this type of product has high requirements for the breathability and corrosion resistance of packaging materials. The company's packaging protection gaskets, made of ePTFE film, can be welded together with various shapes of electromagnetic induction aluminum foil gaskets, meeting the requirements of waterproof, dustproof, oil-resistant, breathable, and corrosion-resistant for chemicals, liquid organic fertilizers, and other products during the packaging process. The company's sealing component products mainly include sealing rings, sponge strips, shock pads, etc., which are used to fill various gaps to achieve sealing, dustproof, and shock absorption. The company's sealing component products are mainly made of EPDM, polyurethane foam, PU sponge, and other rubber materials, widely used in the automotive and home appliance industries. Automotive seals are one of the important components of automobiles and are widely used in car doors, windows, bodies, sunroofs, engines, car lights, car air conditioners, trunks, etc. They have functions such as sealing, waterproofing, dustproofing, and shock absorption, maintaining and protecting the internal environment of the car, and protecting the passengers, mechanical and electrical devices, and accessories. Sealing, waterproofing, dustproofing, shock absorption, etc. Xingyu car lights, SAIC Volkswagen, SAIC Group, Huayu Vision, etc. Wuxi Denso, SAIC General Motors, SAIC Volkswagen, etc. Engine compartment, chassis, car air conditioning. 2. Home appliance seals Sealing products are important accessories for home appliances, mainly used for oil resistance, corrosion resistance, and gas sealing. For example, in the working process of air conditioner compressors, there is a connection gap at the shaft joint, which is prone to gas leakage, resulting in low efficiency of the compressor. The use of sealing products can effectively prevent gas leakage and improve the efficiency of the compressor. Currently, the company's home appliance sealing products are mainly used in air conditioners and range hoods. Oil resistance, corrosion resistance, gas sealing, etc. With the rapid development of the automotive industry, people have higher requirements for the comfort, waterproofing, and sound insulation performance of automobiles. Since car windows need to be opened and closed, rainwater and dust can enter the car doors through the gaps between the glass and the doors. At the same time, noise from the engine, tires, etc., can be transmitted to the interior of the car through the vibration of the car body and frame. Therefore, in order to improve the driving experience of automobiles, some OEMs choose to paste water-blocking films on the inner side of the double-layer sheet metal of car doors. On the one hand, water-blocking films can protect the normal operation of the circuits inside the car doors and prevent external rainwater, dust, etc. from entering. On the other hand, water-blocking films can also play a certain role in blocking noise. The company's water-blocking film products can be divided into three categories based on different raw materials: PE water-blocking film, EVA water-blocking film, and XPE water-blocking film. (4) Sound insulation products. The company's sound insulation products are mainly supplied to OEMs and automotive interior manufacturers, and are installed in positions such as the center console, car doors, glove boxes, and floors to reduce noise. According to the production process and raw materials, the company's sound insulation products mainly include basic sound-absorbing cotton and ePTFE film composite sound-absorbing cotton. The main raw materials of basic sound-absorbing cotton are PP or PET and other high molecular fibers, with a fiber fineness of 0.218μm, forming a dense porous structure by interlacing with each other. Sound is mainly transmitted through air vibration. When the vibrating air passes through the dense porous structure formed by the interlacing of sound-absorbing cotton fibers, the air molecules will continuously generate friction with the fiber material, converting sound energy into heat energy, thereby achieving sound insulation and noise reduction effects. Currently, the main customers of the company's basic sound-absorbing cotton products include well-known OEMs such as SAIC Volkswagen and FAW Volkswagen. 2. ePTFE film composite sound-absorbing cotton. The company's ePTFE film composite sound-absorbing cotton products are composed of ePTFE film and basic sound-absorbing cotton. By changing the micro-pore structure and distribution of the ePTFE film through process means, the originally sound-permeable film becomes a film with strong sound insulation and sound absorption effects. Compared with basic sound-absorbing cotton, ePTFE film composite sound-absorbing cotton can reduce the weight of sound-absorbing cotton by more than 40% under the same sound absorption coefficient, not only meeting the lightweight development trend of the automotive industry but also reducing costs for downstream OEM customers. At the same time, ePTFE film composite sound-absorbing cotton has natural waterproof function and can be widely used in automotive exterior parts (underbody shields, wheel covers, bumpers, etc.) to enhance their sound insulation and noise reduction performance. The company's ePTFE film composite sound-absorbing cotton products have reached Class 1 acoustic requirements of Volkswagen and AUDI4 acoustic requirements of Audi, and their performance indicators are at an advanced level in the industry. The main customer of this product is SAIC Volkswagen, and it has been used in models such as Lavida, Tiguan, Passat, and Touareg, and will be promoted to Audi's high-end model series in the future. (5) Gas management products. The company's gas management products mainly include desiccants and defogging agents, which can manage the gas humidity in small enclosed spaces. Currently, these products are mainly used in automotive headlights. The company's desiccant products are environmentally friendly high-humidity absorption desiccants made of magnesium salt. They are composite materials with special microstructures such as high specific surface area, micro-nano pores, and low density. The materials do not contain heavy metals and can be treated as ordinary waste after use. The company's desiccants absorb moisture in the air through chemical reactions and solidify it, while ensuring no halogen return in the specified use environment. The desiccants produced by the company have the characteristics of aggressive moisture absorption, greatly improved moisture absorption speed, and the maximum moisture absorption can reach more than 200% of their own weight. Their performance is 4-5 times that of ordinary silica gel desiccants, allowing the environmental humidity to quickly drop to the ideal level. The defogging agent is a product developed based on the company's ePTFE film manufacturing technology and desiccant formulation. It has the function of internal humidity regulation and can effectively manage the moisture in small enclosed spaces. This product can achieve ""reversible drying"" function by adsorbing and desorbing moisture at room temperature, forming a ""humidity control system"" in small enclosed spaces, and effectively managing the condensation problem in small enclosed spaces. The defogging agent consists of a plastic shell, filled with drying material and ePTFE waterproof and breathable film, with a moisture absorption rate of more than 180%. Compared with conventional defogging solutions, the defogging agent has the characteristics of high moisture absorption rate and reversibility at room temperature, so a small amount of defogging agent can meet the defogging needs, making it suitable for use in small enclosed spaces. The company's desiccant and defogging agent products are mainly supplied to domestic and foreign well-known car light companies such as Huayu Vision, Valeo, Marelli, Mandeguangdian, Liangwang car lights, Anruilight, etc., and have been applied to corresponding models of SAIC Volkswagen, Great Wall Motor, GM Wuling, Geely Automobile, and other OEMs, achieving preliminary import substitution of foreign desiccant products. The company has strong mechanical equipment development and manufacturing capabilities. Since most of the company's production equipment is non-standard customized products, and there is a need for the confidentiality of core technologies, the company independently designs and manufactures most of the mechanical equipment used in the production of ePTFE films and their application components. At the same time, the company is also one of the few enterprises in China with the design and production capabilities of medicinal controlled-release patch equipment (a type of coating equipment). During the reporting period, the company undertook external equipment orders from customers such as Changzhou Sihao Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and generated certain sales revenue. The core components of the equipment use imported precision mechanical parts such as ball screws and rolling guides, mainly used for die-cutting processing of plastic films, rubber products, foaming materials, and various bonding, cushioning, insulation, and conductive materials. Packaging, pharmaceuticals, new material production and manufacturing. Mainly used for precise coating of other materials on the surface of materials. The equipment adopts metering spraying technology, hollow coating technology, etc., and the accuracy of online monitoring of coating thickness can reach ±1μm. CMD is an innovative product developed by the company, which solves the condensation problem in small enclosed spaces. Taking car lights as an example, when the car lights are closed, the internal and external pressures of the lights are balanced, and the CMD silicone valve is closed. At this time, the moisture-absorbing material absorbs moisture inside the car lights. When the car lights are turned on, the temperature inside the lights rises, and the air pressure increases. The silicone valve opens (opening pressure of 150Pa), and the moisture-absorbing material absorbs the infrared energy behind the light source for drying and discharges the water vapor with pressure. When the car lights are closed again, the temperature inside the lights decreases, and the air pressure decreases. The external air enters the lights through moisture absorption until the internal and external pressures of the lights are balanced, and the silicone valve is closed. Currently, the main method in the industry to solve the fogging problem of car lights is to use a combination of breathable plugs, breathable films, ventilation pipes, desiccants, and anti-fog coatings. The design and verification of the entire solution are complicated and costly. The company's CMD combines the infrared heat of car lights with reversible drying control technology and ePTFE film protection application technology, replacing traditional industry solutions, greatly reducing downstream customer costs. CMD can not only be applied in the automotive lighting industry but also in many other fields. Among them, CMD pressure relief valves are mainly used in new energy power battery packs and have obtained orders from CATL. Compared with ordinary pressure relief valves, CMD pressure relief valves integrate the main functions of CMD and ordinary pressure relief valves. They can quickly release pressure when the gas pressure inside the battery pack rises sharply and solve the condensation problem inside the battery pack caused by temperature changes. In the future, the company also plans to gradually expand the application of CMD in outdoor lighting, new energy vehicle charging control modules, and energy storage devices for 5G outdoor base stations. 4. The main composition of the company's main business income. 5. The situation of the company's main reserve products. (1) 30-50 meters high waterproof and pressure-resistant sound-permeable film. The 30-50 meters high waterproof and pressure-resistant sound-permeable film is a product that the company has upgraded based on the existing waterproof and pressure-resistant sound-permeable film technology, which can achieve IP68 waterproof and dustproof levels. This product not only has an insertion loss of ≤2dB but also can remain leak-free under a water pressure of 30-50 meters deep for 10 minutes. Currently, the 30-meter sound-permeable film has entered the Xiaomi supply chain system and started small-scale supply, while the 50-meter sound-permeable film has passed the testing and certification of vivo smartwatches. SiO2 aerogel is a new type of micro-porous material with extremely low volume density and thermal conductivity. It is known as the ""lightest solid material"" and the ""best performance insulation material"". Its pore size is smaller than the average free path of air molecules at atmospheric pressure, so the air molecules in the aerogel pores are approximately stationary, avoiding convective heat transfer of air. The extremely low volume density and the curved path of the nano-grid porous structure of the aerogel also prevent gaseous and solid heat conduction, tending to ""infinite"" void walls, which can reduce thermal radiation to a minimum. The combination of these three factors almost blocks all heat transfer paths, making the aerogel have insulation effects that other materials cannot match. The company further improves the insulation performance of SiO2 aerogel by compounding it with other materials and overcomes its fragility and powdering shortcomings, developing two high-performance SiO2 aerogel composite materials as the company's reserve products. SiO2 aerogel composite material with ePTFE film has excellent insulation, flame retardancy, and flexibility, and can be used in consumer electronics built-in chips and automotive insulation and heat preservation enclosures, providing good insulation support, cushioning, and sound insulation effects. At the same time, the composite material has high thermal insulation protection effects on pipelines for major gas and oil transmission projects, does not freeze in extremely low-temperature environments, can work for more than 20 years under long-term exposure to ultraviolet rays, and reduces the cost and long-term maintenance of projects requiring thermal insulation and sound insulation. Currently, the composite material has been applied to SAIC Volkswagen's Touareg model as an insulation and sound insulation material. 2. SiO2 aerogel fiberglass felt composite material. SiO2 aerogel fiberglass felt composite material is mainly used in new energy power battery packs. The battery pack is the main energy storage device for battery packs mounted on electric vehicles and is a key component of BEV and PHEV. The working temperature range of the power battery pack is generally in the range of +5°C to +40°C, and its performance can be effectively exerted within this temperature range. When the working temperature of the power battery pack is lower or higher than the temperature range, the life of the power battery pack will be reduced, and it will be unsafe. Its performance directly affects the safety and reliability of new energy vehicles. SiO2 aerogel fiberglass felt composite material introduces fiberglass felt reinforcement composite in the SiO2 aerogel manufacturing process, increasing its high-temperature resistance to above 800°C, which can withstand the high-temperature energy impact caused by short circuits in the battery pack, thereby buying valuable escape time for passengers in electric vehicles. The product has a thermal conductivity of 0.017W/(m·k) or less at room temperature, and a thermal conductivity between 0.047~0.066W/(m·k) at 600°C, exceeding the thermal conductivity requirements of SAIC General Motors' battery pack. Currently, the company is in discussions with CATL for cooperation."	Intelligent manufacturing	1.

Traditional polyurethane foam insulation materials are still widely used as the main insulation materials in household refrigeration equipment such as refrigerators and freezers due to their simple processing and low cost. In addition, rigid polyurethane foam is also widely used in refrigerated containers, cold storage, and other fields.Currently, refrigerators and freezers produced and used in major developed regions and countries such as Europe, North America, Japan, and South Korea have extensively replaced rigid polyurethane foam with vacuum insulation panels. However, China is currently the world's largest producer and exporter of refrigerators, but the usage rate of vacuum insulation panels is still low, mainly using rigid polyurethane foam, which is produced using hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) as blowing agents. Since HCFCs can deplete the ozone layer, they will gradually be replaced by other materials. China has gradually developed alternative foaming technologies using hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), hydrocarbons (HC), and water. However, according to the reduction schedule set by the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which came into effect on January 1, 2019, most developing countries, including China, will freeze the production and consumption of HFCs as the main foaming agent by 2024. By 2029, they will reduce it by 10% from the baseline level and reduce it to 80% by 2045. At present, there is still no better alternative foaming technology for polyurethane foam. Therefore, as future energy-saving and environmental protection policies become stricter and product energy efficiency standards continue to improve, the substitution effect of vacuum insulation panels as a new, efficient, energy-saving, and environmentally friendly insulation material for polyurethane foam will become more apparent, and the market penetration rate will continue to increase.Vacuum insulation panels have excellent insulation performance, with a thermal conductivity only about 1/6 or even lower than that of traditional insulation materials. They also have advantages such as thin thickness, small volume, and light weight. They meet the requirements of high energy efficiency and high volume ratio in the field of household appliances (refrigerators, freezers). As an important component of refrigerators, vacuum insulation panels play a crucial role in improving the energy efficiency of refrigerators and freezers. Vacuum insulation panels cannot be divided due to the need to maintain internal vacuum. They do not have universal specifications. The size, dimensions, thickness, and shape are customized by specific customers according to the design of different end products. Therefore, the company mainly adopts a production mode that satisfies customers' small-batch, customized, rapid response, and high stability requirements. It establishes strategic cooperative relationships with important downstream customers and participates in the research and development design work of vacuum insulation panel placement and structural optimization when customers design new products and models, in order to better serve downstream customers and increase customer loyalty.The company's main customers include numerous well-known domestic and international home appliance manufacturers. International customers include LG, Samsung, Toshiba Home Appliances, Hitachi, Aucma, Fisker, Whirlpool, Bosch Home Appliances, etc. Domestic customers include Haier, Midea, Meiling, Hisense, and other well-known brand home appliance manufacturers. In addition, the company also sells some products to medical research or transportation insulation equipment manufacturers such as Thermo Fisher Scientific and Haier Biomedical.The company's main product is vacuum insulation panels, which are mainly composed of core materials, barrier films, and adsorbents. The core material is one of the main components of vacuum insulation panels and is generally made of porous medium materials such as glass fiber, powdered silica, and open-cell PU. Its functions mainly include structural support to prevent shrinkage and collapse of vacuum insulation panels under internal vacuum conditions, prevention of thermal radiation, and reduction of heat conduction. Due to its porous nature and small contact area, it can effectively reduce heat transfer caused by thermal conduction. The main raw material for the company's vacuum insulation panel core material is glass fiber, which has good insulation performance, low gas release, high flame retardancy, and certain strength. It can provide good structural support and is currently the most widely used core material for vacuum insulation panels. The company uses glass fiber chopped strands to prepare the core material of vacuum insulation panels instead of centrifugal cotton, which has cost advantages and further improves insulation performance.The barrier film is mainly composed of base film and multiple layers of special film composite. It generally includes a water vapor barrier layer, gas barrier layer, thermal insulation layer, radiation protection layer, heat sealing layer, and protective layer. Its main functions are to encapsulate and isolate, and prevent penetration. On the one hand, it encapsulates the core material to isolate it from the outside air and maintain its internal vacuum. On the other hand, it is a dense material that effectively prevents nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, and other substances from permeating into the interior of the vacuum insulation panel. In addition, the performance of the barrier film also includes reducing the influence of heat conduction and thermal radiation. High-performance barrier films can minimize solid-state heat conduction and high-temperature thermal radiation through material improvements. Barrier films are generally made of multi-layer composite materials. Common materials used to manufacture barrier films include polymer materials and metal materials. Among them, aluminum-plated polyester composite barrier films have been widely used in large-scale industrial applications, but some raw materials rely on imports. The company has independently developed nano high-barrier films, which have excellent barrier performance and weather resistance. They are currently in the trial production and customer certification stage and will promote the independent innovation of core components in the domestic vacuum insulation panel industry after mass production.The adsorbent is mainly made of metal particles with adsorption properties according to a reasonable formula. Placing adsorbents is mainly to adsorb excess gas generated by external penetration or gas released from the internal material, as well as to prevent the infiltration of water vapor into the vacuum insulation panel, ensuring better vacuum and maintaining the insulation performance and service life of the vacuum insulation panel. The suitable adsorbent formula and composition for vacuum insulation panels vary. The company conducts in-depth research on the physical and chemical properties of raw materials through independent research and development. By analyzing the composition and quantity of internal and external gases in the vacuum insulation panel, it accurately designs the composition of adsorbent materials to achieve optimal gas adsorption capacity. The company has achieved self-production of adsorbents, completed import substitution, and effectively reduced production costs.The performance of vacuum insulation panels is excellent. As refrigerators are widely used in global economic and social life and have the characteristics of continuous use and continuous power supply, they are one of the appliances with high power consumption among household appliances. Improving the energy efficiency standards of refrigerator products is of great significance for reducing overall energy consumption in society. Therefore, in recent years, countries and regions such as the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and North America have successively issued relevant policies and regulations to continuously improve the energy efficiency standards of refrigerator products. The key way to improve the energy efficiency standards of refrigerators is to use better-performing insulation materials, and vacuum insulation panels meet this requirement. Therefore, they have gradually been applied in the field of refrigerator appliances. In June 2019, the National Development and Reform Commission and other seven departments issued the ""Green and Efficient Refrigeration Action Plan,"" which requires that by 2022, the market share of green and efficient refrigeration products should increase by 20%, achieving an annual electricity saving of about 100 billion kilowatt-hours. By 2030, the market share of green and efficient refrigeration products should increase by more than 40%, achieving an annual electricity saving of about 400 billion kilowatt-hours. According to the current electricity price level, by 2030, green and efficient refrigeration products can save electricity costs of 200-250 billion yuan per year. Vacuum insulation panels can effectively reduce the thickness of the insulation layer, reduce the amount of foaming material, and increase internal storage space, thereby reducing the power consumption of products. According to relevant research, using vacuum insulation panels as insulation materials in general refrigerators can save energy by 10% to 30%, achieving significant energy-saving effects.Global warming has become an important obstacle to the sustainable development of the economy and society. Controlling pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions has received high attention from countries. On July 5, 2017, the European Parliament approved the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which aims to reduce hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) used in heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration. In October 2016, a global agreement was reached on the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which aims to reduce HFCs. The Kigali Amendment came into effect on January 1, 2019. Developed countries will take the lead in reducing such potent greenhouse gases. These countries will reduce HFCs by 10% from the baseline level (average of 2011-2013) starting from 2019 and reduce it by 85% by 2036. Developing countries are divided into two groups: the first group includes most developing countries, including China and African countries. The first group of developing countries will freeze HFCs consumption by 2024 and start the reduction process from 2029. The second group includes a small number of developing countries, including India, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and Gulf countries. They can delay the freezing and reduction of HFCs. The second group of developing countries will freeze the use of HFCs from 2028 and start reducing HFCs consumption from 2032. The production and application of vacuum insulation panels do not produce ozone-depleting substances (ODS) or HFCs super greenhouse gases. Moreover, the core material of vacuum insulation panels can be recycled, making it an environmentally friendly material. The company's products have been tested by international authoritative testing institutions such as SGS for many years and have passed the EU RoHS and REACH testing and certification. They meet the requirements of greenness and safety and have obtained the passport to enter the international market. They are exported to countries and regions such as South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Europe, North America, and the Middle East. Due to the outstanding insulation effect of vacuum insulation panels, thinner panels can achieve the same insulation effect as much thicker traditional materials, saving a lot of space. For refrigerators and freezers, the rapid development of multi-door refrigerators, such as the Cross Four-door in 2014, the Haier F+ series in 2017, and other French-style five-door products, and the release of five M Fresh ""Comprehensive Thin"" refrigerators by Changhong Meiling in 2019, which integrate vacuum insulation technology, have thinner bodies, machine bodies, and doors compared to conventional refrigerators, increasing the volume ratio by 20% and reducing the floor space by 38%. They have become new engines for the growth of the multi-door market. Vacuum insulation panels, with their superior insulation performance, can achieve the same insulation effect as traditional materials with only one-tenth of the thickness, saving a significant amount of space. They have become one of the key technologies for increasing the volume ratio of refrigerators. Vacuum insulation panels are widely used in the sides, back, and door areas of multi-door refrigerators to improve energy-saving efficiency. The rapid development of these refrigerator categories has significantly expanded the application space of the vacuum insulation panel industry."	Intelligent manufacturing	1.

426	Anhui Yishitong Material Technology Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft for Review)	High-end equipment	The company is committed to the cutting-edge application of advanced inorganic non-metallic composite materials. Through years of industry accumulation, it has formed differentiated competitive advantages. The main products include lithium battery coating materials, electronic communication functional filling materials, and low-smoke halogen-free flame retardant materials. Inorganic non-metallic materials have good insulation, strong heat resistance, and stable chemical properties. They are widely used in new energy vehicles, consumer electronics, chips, copper-clad laminates, and fire safety. The company's lithium battery coating materials, such as boehmite, are the main components of inorganic coating materials for lithium batteries. By coating the battery separator or electrode, the safety performance of lithium batteries can be improved, and the yield of battery cells can be increased. The company's low-smoke halogen-free flame retardant materials can effectively improve the flame retardancy and fire resistance of downstream products, meeting the increasing demand for safety and reliability in downstream industries. Electronic communication functional filling materials can effectively ensure high-frequency and high-speed signal transmission, improving the stability of downstream products. The promising prospects of downstream industries will drive the rapid development of the company's main business. According to statistics from the Gao Gong Industrial Research Institute, the company's boehmite for lithium batteries ranks first in China and second in the world in terms of shipments. The company's electronic communication functional filling materials have entered Huawei's 5G product supply chain through providing products to Shengyi Technology. The wire and cable using the company's low-smoke halogen-free flame retardant materials as flame retardants have been tested by the National Wire and Cable Quality Supervision Center and achieved the highest level of flame retardancy specified by the National Fire Protection Standardization Technical Committee. The company's main products are in the upstream position of the industry chain, and their quality directly affects the key performance of downstream products. 1. Lithium battery coating materials: Lithium battery coating is a process of coating the battery separator or electrode of lithium batteries. It can improve the heat resistance and puncture resistance of the battery separator, reduce the moisture content of the coated separator, improve the rate performance and cycle performance of lithium batteries, reduce self-discharge of battery cells, increase the yield of battery cells, and improve the safety performance of lithium batteries. In the coating process, lithium battery coating materials are uniformly coated on the battery separator or positive/negative electrode materials by coating machines. Lithium battery manufacturers will then assemble the coated separator or coated positive/negative electrode materials with electrolyte and other raw materials to prepare battery cells, which are further assembled into lithium batteries for applications in new energy vehicles, consumer electronics, energy storage, etc. Currently, there are three technical routes for lithium battery coating on the market: inorganic material coating, organic material coating, and a combination of organic and inorganic material coating. Among them, inorganic coating separators have better tensile strength and thermal shrinkage, and downstream customers have formed industrial applications, making them the mainstream coating materials. Since it is difficult to directly coat particles on lithium battery separators or electrodes, lithium battery manufacturers and separator manufacturers generally prepare coating slurries as coating materials. The main components of the coating slurry include coating particles, resin materials, and water. In the technical route of inorganic material coating, the coating particles refer to the company's lithium battery coating material product, boehmite, which is the main raw material for lithium battery coating materials. Figure 1 shows the downstream applications of lithium battery coating materials. 2. Electronic communication functional filling materials: The company's electronic communication functional filling materials are high-performance functional fillers filled in the packaging materials of electronic chips and printed circuit boards.

467	Huahai Qingke Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft)	High-end equipment	"The company's main product is CMP equipment with core independent intellectual property rights. Integrated circuits use a certain process to fabricate all the components required in a circuit, such as transistors, resistors, capacitors, and inductors, as well as the connecting wires between them, on a small semiconductor chip such as a silicon wafer or a dielectric substrate. The chip is then encapsulated in a tube shell to become an electronic device with the required circuit function. The manufacturing process of integrated circuits is like building a multi-story building. Each floor needs to be flat and smooth enough to continue building another floor on top. Otherwise, the floor will be uneven, affecting overall performance and reliability. The technology that can effectively make the ""floors"" of integrated circuits reach nanometer-level global flatness is CMP technology, and CMP equipment is the ultra-precision equipment for implementing CMP process on silicon wafers/wafers. Through continuous independent research and development of key technologies, the company's CMP equipment integrates advanced polishing systems, endpoint detection systems, ultra-clean cleaning systems, precise transmission systems, and other key functional modules. It has more than dozens of highly integrated core technologies, especially key technologies such as nanometer-level polishing, nanometer particle ultra-clean cleaning, nanometer thickness online detection, big data analysis, and intelligent control. It solves key problems in integrated circuit manufacturing at the nanoscale, such as ""polishing"" at the nanoscale, ""global polishing"" of wafers, ""accurate stopping"" of nanometer thickness, and ""cleaning"" of nanometer particles. It also ensures the nanometer-level global flatness of wafers and the integrity of microstructures, making it an indispensable ultra-precision automated equipment in advanced integrated circuit manufacturing processes. Chip manufacturing mainly includes key process technologies such as lithography, CMP, etching, thin film, and doping. Among them, CMP is a new technology that emerged when the chip manufacturing process and process evolution reached a certain level and could not continue to advance due to the lack of suitable polishing technology according to Moore's Law. Since IBM applied CMP technology to the manufacturing of 4MDRAM chips in 1988, the integrated circuit manufacturing process has gradually become more dependent on CMP technology, mainly due to the miniaturization of device feature sizes (CD) and the introduction of new materials. In particular, after entering the 0.25μm node, the importance of CMP technology became more prominent with the introduction of Al wiring and the 0.13μm node with Cu wiring. Its widespread application has enabled the continued advancement of Moore's Law. After entering the 90-65nm node, with the widespread adoption of copper interconnect technology and low-k dielectrics (an insulating material), CMP mainly focuses on copper interconnect layers, insulating films, and shallow trench isolation (STI). Starting from 28nm, the introduction of high-k metal gate structures (HKMG) in logic devices also introduced two key planarization applications, namely virtual gate opening CMP process and alternative metal gate CMP process. At the 32nm and 22nm nodes, CMP technology supports the mass production of devices with copper interconnects and low-k dielectrics. The FinFET transistors introduced at the 22nm node added virtual gate planarization technology, which is a key technology for subsequent 3D structure etching. Advanced DRAM storage devices use gate metal planarization technology before trench etching to form buried gate structures. After the introduction of high-mobility channel materials between layers (such as III-V materials for nFET and germanium for pFET), it is necessary to combine Damascus-type processes and backside polishing for these new materials. In addition, CMP also plays a crucial role in polishing phase change materials in phase change memory (PCRAM) technology. As shown in Figure 1, the removal rates of traditional mechanical polishing and chemical polishing are too low to meet the requirements of advanced chip mass production. Therefore, CMP technology combines the advantages of mechanical polishing and chemical polishing to avoid surface damage caused by pure mechanical polishing and utilize the principle of ""soft grinding hard"" in wear, that is, using softer materials for polishing to achieve high-quality surface polishing. It balances chemical corrosion and mechanical grinding to achieve ultra-high surface flatness of the wafer, making it the only polishing technology that takes into account both global and local planarization in advanced integrated circuit manufacturing. If the wafer (chip) manufacturing process cannot achieve nanometer-level global planarization, it is impossible to repeat key processes such as lithography, etching, thin film, and doping, and it is also impossible to reduce the process node to the nanometer level in the advanced field. Therefore, as the linewidth of ultra-large-scale integrated circuit manufacturing continues to shrink, there is a higher demand for planarization and CMP plays an irreplaceable and increasingly important role in advanced process technology. With the continuation of Moore's Law, the requirements for CMP technology will increase and the steps will continue to increase as the manufacturing process continues to advance to advanced process nodes. For example, when the process node develops below 7nm, the application of CMP in the chip manufacturing process has added advanced CMP technologies such as nitride CMP, fin poly-Si CMP, and tungsten metal gate CMP based on the initial oxide CMP and tungsten CMP. The required polishing steps have also increased to more than 30, which has greatly stimulated the demand for the purchase and upgrade of CMP equipment by integrated circuit manufacturers. CMP equipment mainly relies on the principle of chemical-mechanical dynamic coupling of CMP technology to achieve efficient removal of excess material on the wafer surface and nanometer-level global planarization through the synergistic combination of chemical corrosion and mechanical grinding. It involves multiple disciplines such as integrated circuits, machinery, materials, physics, mechanics, chemistry, chemical engineering, electronics, computer, instrumentation, optics, control, and software engineering. The research and development and manufacturing are difficult. Previously, the global market was mainly monopolized by two companies, Applied Materials from the United States and Ebara from Japan. Currently, the company's commercial models have successfully replaced imports and entered the production lines of domestic and foreign advanced integrated circuit manufacturers. CMP equipment includes three major modules: polishing, cleaning, and transmission. Figures 3 and 4 show the core polishing module in the equipment. During the operation, the polishing head presses the wafer surface to be polished against the rough polishing pad, and the global planarization is achieved through the coupling of chemical corrosion, particle friction, and polishing pad friction. The polishing disc drives the rotation of the polishing pad, and the advanced endpoint detection system realizes real-time thickness measurement of different materials and thicknesses of films with a resolution of 3-10nm to prevent over-polishing. The key technology lies in the polishing head that can apply pressure to the entire global area, which can achieve ultra-precision and controllable unidirectional pressure on multiple annular regions of the wafer within a limited space. It can adjust the pressure control of wafer polishing morphology based on the thickness data measured by the polishing disc, so that the surface of the wafer after polishing reaches ultra-high flatness (for example, if the requirement for global flatness is 10nm, it is equivalent to the height difference between any two points on the Tiananmen Square with an area of approximately 440,000 square meters not exceeding 0.03mm), and the surface roughness is less than 0.5nm, which is equivalent to one hundred thousandth of a hair. In addition, as the process linewidth continues to shrink and the polishing liquid formula becomes more complex, it becomes more difficult to clean after polishing, and the requirement for the number of particles after CMP cleaning decreases exponentially. Therefore, the cleaning unit in CMP equipment needs to have strong cleaning capabilities to achieve more thorough cleaning effects without damaging the surface's limit microstructures. The silicon wafers used by integrated circuit manufacturers are divided into types such as 6 inches, 8 inches, and 12 inches according to their diameter standards. Currently, the high-end market for processes below 90nm generally uses 12-inch wafers. Compared with 8-inch CMP equipment, 12-inch CMP equipment has a 50% increase in diameter and a 125% increase in area, requiring higher precision. It needs more advanced polishing head ultra-precision zoning pressure control technology and more advanced endpoint detection technology. Therefore, 12-inch CMP equipment is recognized in the industry as a benchmark product for measuring the R&D technology level of CMP equipment manufacturers. The company is currently the only domestic high-end semiconductor equipment manufacturer that produces commercial models of 12-inch CMP equipment. 2. Specific product information of the company.

481	Shanghai Kaisai Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft for Registration)	High-end equipment	"The company is a high-tech enterprise that is based on disciplines such as synthetic biology and utilizes biomanufacturing technology to engage in the research, production, and sales of new bio-based materials. The company's current commercially produced products mainly focus on the polyamide industry chain, including bio-based polyamides and raw materials used in the production of bio-based polyamides, such as DC12 (lauric acid), DC13 (brassylic acid), and other bio-based long-chain dicarboxylic acid series products, as well as bio-based pentanediamine. The company is one of the global leaders in the large-scale production of new materials using biomanufacturing. Dicarboxylic acids and diamines can be polymerized to obtain polyamides and can also be used as synthetic raw materials for fragrances, hot melt adhesives, lubricants, coatings, and more. Currently, the company's bio-based long-chain dicarboxylic acid series products, bio-based pentanediamine, and bio-based polyamide products are widely used in various fields such as automotive, electronics, textiles, pharmaceuticals, and fragrances. The company has established good business cooperation relationships with internationally renowned companies such as DuPont, Evonik, BASF, and Novozymes. The company's bio-based long-chain dicarboxylic acid series products are leading in the global market and were awarded the Manufacturing Industry Champion by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in 2018. As of the date of this prospectus, the company's bio-based pentanediamine (primarily for internal use as a monomer for bio-based polyamide production) and bio-based polyamide products have completed pilot production. The large-scale production line at the Wusu factory is undergoing equipment debugging. The large-scale production of these products is expected to solve the bottleneck problem of relying on imported core raw materials in the domestic polyamide industry and provide the market and customers with new ""biomanufacturing"" materials derived from renewable biomass raw materials. The company's current main products and important reserve products are shown in the following table: Bio-based long-chain dicarboxylic acid series products typically refer to fatty dicarboxylic acids with ten or more carbon atoms in the carbon chain, which are important fine chemical intermediates. Traditionally, they are mainly produced by chemical methods, but the company uses biomanufacturing methods, which have advantages such as a wider range of product types, lower costs, and more environmental friendliness. They are mainly used in high-performance long-chain polyamides, fragrances, hot melt adhesives, lubricants, cold-resistant plasticizers, and powder coatings. Lysine is a compound produced by decarboxylation under the action of decarboxylase and can be used as a raw material in the production of polyamides and other chemical processes. The domestic polyamide industry (especially polyamide 66) has long been restricted by the supply of raw materials from European and American companies. The company's achievement in large-scale production of this product is expected to break the import monopoly. It can be used as a raw material for polyamide 56, polyamide 5X, and other chemical production processes. Currently, it is primarily used for internal use as a monomer for bio-based polyamide production and is partially provided to downstream customers for application development. Polyamide, commonly known as nylon, is a general term for high polymers with amide groups in the main chain of repeating units. Polyamides can be obtained by condensation polymerization of dicarboxylic acids and diamines or by ring-opening polymerization of lactams. Initially used as raw materials for fiber production, it has become a widely used engineering plastic in the industry due to its advantages such as toughness, wear resistance, self-lubrication, and a wide range of operating temperatures. The company develops bio-based polyamide series products by polymerizing bio-based pentanediamine with various dicarboxylic acids. Bio-based polyamide series products represented by polyamide 56 have been tested and recognized by domestic and foreign users and are expected to be widely used in fields such as textiles and engineering materials. Note: During the reporting period, the bio-based long-chain dicarboxylic acid series products were the company's main products, accounting for 99.62%, 99.70%, and 99.56% of the main business income. During the reporting period, a small amount of bio-based polyamide and bio-based pentanediamine products developed and produced by the Jinxiang pilot line and Wusu factory were sold externally. The company's current development direction mainly focuses on the polyamide industry chain, and bio-based polyamide and bio-based pentanediamine products are important components of the polyamide industry chain. Although they did not generate sales revenue during the reporting period, they are important reserve products for the company in terms of ongoing research and development and investment construction direction. Currently, the large-scale production line of bio-based polyamide and bio-based pentanediamine at the Wusu factory is undergoing equipment debugging. Biomanufacturing, as a revolutionary production method, uses biomass as raw materials or applies biological methods for large-scale material processing and transformation, providing industrial commodities (such as new material products) for social development. The production process is green, mild, and economical. It is an effective way to solve the excessive dependence of humans on traditional petrochemical and chemical products, as well as the accompanying environmental pollution and safety risks. The future development space is very broad. Since its establishment, the company has accumulated profound experience in the field of biomanufacturing through nearly 20 years of research and development investment and technological accumulation. It has developed into a globally renowned research and development platform for biomanufacturing theoretical technology and industrialization methods, with research and development teams in disciplines such as synthetic biology, cell engineering, biochemical engineering, polymer materials, and engineering, and has hundreds of patents. In the future, with technological progress and the continuous exploration of downstream demand, the iteration and innovation of the company's products will lead to the continuous expansion of product application areas, providing the company with broad growth space."

After each garment is processed, the RFID reader scans the RFID chip in the carrier to complete counting, positioning, logical judgment, and intelligent calculation, achieving real-time monitoring and display of the online quantity of each process, and effectively solving production bottleneck problems. Compared with the traditional bundling production mode (bundling flow), the intelligent hanging production system production mode (intelligent single-piece flow) has the following advantages: replacing manual handling and statistics, realizing automatic data collection, intelligent process balancing (real-time monitoring the efficiency of each workstation, discovering bottlenecks, and making timely adjustments between workstations to maximize production line efficiency), real-time and accurate intelligent rework (inspection personnel timely detect defective products, and the system automatically sends them back to the original production process workstation for rework), automatic matching of cutting pieces, automatic recording and statistics of employee work quantity and quality, etc. It can effectively improve the production efficiency, product quality, and production management level of the sewing workshop, reduce work-in-progress, labor costs, and management costs, and enhance profitability. The system uses a before-and-after production mode comparison: track intelligent transportation, not limited by the length of the processing line and the arrangement of processing positions; computerized automatic collection, real-time monitoring; chip recognition, fast and accurate identification; material accumulation, messy environment; orderly hanging and installation of materials, clean environment. The system uses a before-and-after performance comparison: bundling production and transmission, frequent transmission, high labor intensity, and chaotic trajectory, which seriously affects sewing efficiency. The system automatically distributes materials without manual handling, greatly reducing the time occupied by sewing workers for non-sewing work and improving efficiency by about 10%. In small-batch, multi-variety production, the frequent changes in clothing styles and colors require sewing workers to frequently change sewing lines and colors, and adapt to different varieties, which may cause color differences and seriously affect sewing efficiency. After using the intelligent hanging production system, intelligent sorting, coding, and matching of garment parts are achieved, and sewing workers can minimize the time required for processing conversion, improving sewing worker efficiency by about 5%. Under traditional production methods, the production output of finished products takes at least 2-3 days, making it difficult to control the process and accurately estimate the delivery time, which may lead to rush overtime at the end of the delivery period. With the production process control in place, same-day production and same-day delivery can be achieved. Real-time control of the production process through data collection enables accurate estimation of delivery time and improves the delivery capability of the enterprise. With a large number of work-in-progress and a large occupied space, each processing station has a high number of work-in-progress backlog, and it is difficult to digitize the data. In the single-piece flow processing mode, once the work-in-progress is completed, it is immediately sent to the next process, resulting in fewer work-in-progress at each processing station, full utilization of space, and complete data digitization. Manual visual judgment leads to poor coordination between processes, and it is difficult to grasp the ""bottleneck"" process in a timely manner. The system can timely and accurately monitor the imbalance of processing efficiency at each workstation. The computer control system can automatically calculate and provide balanced scheduling suggestions, which can improve efficiency by about 5%. Under the bundling flow, quality control is usually batch quality inspection, and defective products are often discovered late, resulting in a large amount of rework. The time required for rework is usually 0.5-2 days. Under the single-piece flow, quality inspection is done on a piece-by-piece basis, timely discovering quality problems, avoiding delays caused by large-scale rework, and timely statistics of rework reasons and the pass rate of each workstation. Workshop management work is manually completed, which is cumbersome and inefficient, resulting in a large number of management personnel and high costs. Workshop management personnel can be reduced by about 1/3, and the system automatically collects production data, conducts performance analysis, and facilitates management personnel to arrange reasonable working hours, achieving humanized management. The real-time information sample diagram of the intelligent hanging production system workstation. During the reporting period, the company developed various types of intelligent hanging production systems, including S50, S70, S80, S100, etc., targeting different downstream clothing and home textile industries and customer needs. (2) Warehousing and sorting system: A. Intelligent hanging warehousing and sorting system: The intelligent hanging warehousing and sorting system mainly targets the storage, screening, sorting, and matching of group uniforms, custom-made personal clothing, and e-commerce. This system can sort and transport multiple types of clothing, styles, colors, sizes, etc. at the same time, automatically identify item information, and achieve high-speed automatic matching and sorting based on the storage and sorting rules set by the enterprise. It is applied in scenarios with a decentralized ordering mode, meeting the requirements of small-batch, multi-batch rapid turnover and accurate order placement. It can save a large number of warehousing and sorting manpower resources, improve sorting accuracy and speed. Another feature of this system is the use of a three-dimensional and efficient automatic hanging storage mode and an automatic unmanned hanging sorting system, which optimizes the existing workspace environment, fully utilizes the height space of the factory building, and achieves efficient space utilization. It achieves sufficient storage with the smallest area, optimizes the conveying distance, and achieves efficient transportation. The cache, input, and output operate independently without interference. At the same time, the software system can automatically record and process data, and share real-time data information with the enterprise's existing ERP management system and other information systems. Product diagram of the intelligent hanging warehousing system. B. Intelligent non-hanging warehousing and logistics system: The intelligent non-hanging warehousing and logistics system mainly consists of an intelligent warehousing system (three-dimensional warehouse system), a flexible conveying system (automated conveying and handling system), an automated sorting system (cross-sorting, roller sorting, and other flat sorting systems), and an information management system. The warehousing system is connected to the logistics system's dispatching computer, which receives instructions for material transportation, and is connected to the conveying equipment to realize the driving, detection, and identification of the bottom-level equipment, complete the transmission of material transportation and process control information, and achieve the automation and fine management of the warehouse. The sorting system can accurately identify goods at high speed and can sort goods at high speed for a long time. Afterward, the system can determine its priority to enter the sorting and packaging system, increasing the utilization rate of equipment, reducing the pressure on the buffer zone, effectively saving space, and making the site planning more orderly and reasonable. The entire system can be combined and matched with sealing machines and other equipment to achieve fully automatic warehousing, tallying, sorting, packaging, weighing, labeling, and achieve maximum savings in manpower. The company has independently developed warehousing and logistics software systems, which have functions such as basic parameter configuration, task management, monitoring and scheduling, statistical inquiry, data collection, wireless terminals, and intelligent interface systems. The non-hanging warehousing and sorting system is currently in the early stage of development and has not formed a competitive advantage. Although the product foundation has been laid, the sales scale of this product is currently small, mainly serving to improve the overall system supporting capabilities of the company, extend the company's product function chain, and meet the internal warehousing, sorting, and transportation needs of downstream sewing industry customers in the pre and post-production processes. (3) Production management information software system: The company equips the sold production systems and warehousing system equipment with relevant control and information management software. The company also separately sells off-line systems (mainly composed of information collection devices such as barcode scanners, information display devices such as tablet computers, and related management software). The company has developed targeted and comprehensive production management information systems for textile and clothing enterprises, namely MES systems. Due to the comprehensive functions of MES systems in enterprise management, the following introduces the related functions using MES systems as an example. MES software is a manufacturing enterprise production process execution management software, which is a production information management system targeting the workshop execution layer of manufacturing enterprises. Based on a deep understanding of the downstream sewing industry, the MES software developed by the company can achieve bidirectional data integration with customer intelligent hanging production systems, warehousing and sorting systems, ERP systems, etc., providing sewing enterprises with intelligent order management, intelligent planning and scheduling, intelligent labor management, intelligent material control, intelligent cutting management, intelligent cutting piece management, intelligent production management, intelligent personnel control, intelligent production display boards, intelligent quality control, intelligent data monitoring, and other management functional modules, creating a solid, reliable, comprehensive, and feasible manufacturing collaborative management platform for enterprises. Example of MES system data display and analysis. (4) Comprehensive intelligent logistics system: The comprehensive intelligent logistics system is based on the capabilities provided by the company's various subsystems. In a single project contract, it integrates and coordinates the intelligent hanging production subsystems, various warehousing and sorting subsystems, and various supporting software to achieve seamless integration and coordination of material conveying, warehousing, sorting, data collection, and analysis between warehouses and production workshops, forming a complete and comprehensive intelligent logistics system. Through the implementation of contracts, the logistics and data integration of customer factory production and warehousing can be realized, forming an intelligent factory. Due to the customized nature of the company's main business products based on customer needs, the company's operations are mainly based on customer orders. Implementing comprehensive intelligent logistics systems in a single contract is a key development direction for the company in the future."	Intelligent manufacturing	2.

519	Beijing Langshi Instrument Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft)	High-end equipment	"Medical cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a medical imaging device that uses cone-shaped X-ray beams to capture three-dimensional images of the body. It consists of an X-ray generator, flat panel detector, rotating gantry, and computer software. The working principle is as follows: the X-ray generator and flat panel detector rotate around the patient to obtain projection data from different angles. The projection data is then reconstructed into a three-dimensional image using specialized CBCT reconstruction algorithms in the computer, which can be observed and diagnosed by clinical doctors. Due to differences in core components, CBCT can achieve higher spatial resolution than conventional spiral CT and has a smaller size. It is particularly suitable for fine imaging and specialized clinical applications of hard tissues such as teeth and bones. However, CBCT also has technical challenges different from conventional spiral CT, such as cone angle artifacts, data truncation, and scatter problems.(1) Dental CBCT: Dental CBCT is a type of CBCT system mainly used for three-dimensional imaging of the oral and maxillofacial region. It is widely used in various dental specialties such as dental implantation, orthodontics, endodontics, and oral and maxillofacial surgery. Especially in complex applications such as dental implantation, dental CBCT plays an irreplaceable role. Compared to conventional spiral CT, dental CBCT has advantages such as high resolution, low radiation dose, small footprint, and low cost. It is a revolutionary device in the field of oral imaging in the 21st century and is widely used in various levels of dental medical institutions. Figure 3 shows a three-dimensional image obtained from dental CBCT. According to the imaging field of view, dental CBCT is usually divided into small field of view CBCT, medium field of view CBCT, and large field of view CBCT. The imaging diameter and height of small field of view CBCT generally do not exceed 8cm and are mainly used for imaging of local dental arches, local jawbones, and unilateral joints. The imaging diameter and height of large field of view CBCT are generally not less than 15cm and can cover the entire oral and maxillofacial region. The imaging range of medium field of view CBCT is between small and large field of view. The larger the field of view, the wider the application range, while ensuring imaging clarity. According to the different patient positions during imaging, dental CBCT can also be divided into standing, sitting, and supine forms. Standing CBCT is more convenient for multifunctional expansion, cost-effective, and more suitable for primary dental medical institutions. The supine CBCT gantry is the most stable with the highest imaging clarity, but it has a single function and a large footprint, suitable for specialized dental hospitals, etc. The stability, imaging clarity, and functional expandability of sitting CBCT gantry are between standing and supine forms, with a footprint similar to standing CBCT, suitable for public hospitals and high-end private dental medical institutions. After more than ten years of research and development, Longshi Instruments has established a product line of dental CBCT, including the HiRes3D and Smart3D series, covering multi-level medical institutions and meeting comprehensive clinical diagnosis and academic research needs. The company's full range of dental CBCT products have excellent imaging performance, convenient human-computer interaction, and stable and reliable product quality. Through self-developed high-precision reconstruction and other technologies, the products have industry-leading image clarity, with a minimum voxel size of 0.05mm and a resolution of up to 2.6lp/mm. By breaking through key technologies such as large cone angle CT reconstruction, the company's products can achieve a maximum field of view of 23cm×18cm, which can meet various clinical needs such as dental arches, implantation, temporomandibular joint examination, orthodontics, and maxillofacial surgery. Large imaging field of view and high-definition resolution. Positioned for public hospitals and high-end private medical institutions. The earliest domestically produced seated dental CBCT has a maximum imaging field of view of 16cm×15cm and a minimum reconstructed voxel size of 0.05mm. It has multiple imaging functions and high cost-effectiveness. Positioned for grassroots medical institutions. The company's first multi-functional dental CBCT has three major imaging functions: dental CBCT imaging, dental surface layer imaging, and cephalometric imaging. The maximum imaging field of view of the cone beam CT. The minimum reconstructed voxel size is 0.05mm. The world's first four-in-one dental CBCT has four major imaging functions: dental CBCT imaging, dental surface layer imaging, cephalometric imaging, and intraoral dental film imaging. The cone beam CT has the largest imaging field of view. The minimum reconstructed voxel size is 0.05mm. The four-in-one dental CBCT has four major imaging functions: dental CBCT imaging, dental surface layer imaging, cephalometric imaging, and intraoral dental film imaging. The cone beam CT has the largest imaging field of view. The minimum reconstructed voxel size is 0.05mm. Note: The company's Smart3D-X/Xs series is the world's first ""four-in-one"" cone beam CT, which means that one device has four different imaging modes (dental CBCT imaging, dental surface layer imaging, cephalometric imaging, and intraoral dental film imaging).(2) Dental X-ray image processing software: In order to fully utilize the clinical application value of dental X-ray imaging equipment, the company has developed two medical image processing software. One is the multi-functional dental image processing software SmartVPro, which includes patient data management, multi-planar reconstruction, three-dimensional display, panoramic unfolding, cephalometric image generation, temporomandibular joint slice, virtual implantation, clinical reports, and other functions. The other is the cephalometric measurement software CephPro3D, which is dedicated to orthodontics. In addition to patient data management and routine two-dimensional and three-dimensional image processing functions, CephPro3D also has specialized functions such as cephalometric measurement and treatment comparison. CephPro3D can process three-dimensional CT data, and no similar software with similar functions from other brands has been found domestically. The software can switch between multiple cephalometric image generation modes during the measurement process, greatly improving measurement accuracy. Both dental X-ray image processing software have obtained medical device registration certificates. (Multi-functional dental image processing software) In the SmartVPro software, axial, coronal, and sagittal images can be observed simultaneously, and cross-sectional slices can be obtained at any position, including buccolingual and mesiodistal sections, providing convenience for diagnosis. Local fine reconstruction can be performed on specified areas. TrueMAR artifact correction: Longshi Instruments' original metal artifact correction algorithm can effectively reduce metal artifacts. Panoramic unfolding: SmartVPro software can reconstruct new curved sectional images from 3D image data. The image is accurately imaged in a 1:1 ratio, completely overcoming the inherent overlap and deformation problems of traditional curved sectional images. With the virtual implantation function of SmartVPro software, the bone quality and quantity of the implantation area can be evaluated, the neural canal can be outlined, the position of the implant and the relationship with adjacent anatomical structures can be determined, and the optimal length and diameter of the implant can be accurately selected, improving the success rate of implantation and avoiding possible nerve or vascular damage. SmartVPro software can analyze and present the airway, TMJ, and other areas. (Cephalometric measurement software for orthodontics) It supports up to 15 cephalometric measurement methods, and doctors can choose according to clinical needs and usage habits. Accurate and fast acquisition of overlapping images at different stages of treatment, and the overlapping process complies with the American Board of Orthodontics (ABO) certification standards, meeting the diagnostic needs of doctors. The comparison of pre- and post-treatment tracings visually shows the treatment effect, so that the treatment plan can be adjusted in a timely manner. It can facilitate smooth communication between doctors and patients and facilitate the sharing of orthodontic cases by doctors. Posture adjustment: Three-dimensional posture adjustment can be performed on large field of view CBCT images to help doctors observe patient anatomical morphology and generate better cephalometric images."

526	Jiangsu Jicui Yaokang Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft)	High-end equipment	"1. Sales of commercialized mouse models. The company targets major diseases that pose a serious threat to human health, such as tumors, metabolic system diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. It innovatively uses gene editing technologies such as transgenic, ES targeting, CRISPR/Cas9, etc., to develop immunodeficient mouse models, humanized mouse models, and disease mouse models that meet customer demands. These mouse strains are widely used, highly standardized, and practical, providing customers with a variety of options for purchase. Additionally, the company has launched the ""Spot Mouse Program"" based on the market demand for gene knockout mice in the field of life science research. It aims to gradually establish a knockout strain library for all 20,000 protein-coding genes in mice, which can be commercially sold. The company uses DNA microinjection to integrate exogenous DNA into the mouse genome, obtaining mice with overexpression or conditionally overexpressed exogenous genes. This method allows for large fragment insertion and may result in random insertion of multiple copies. It is not limited by patents. The company also uses homologous recombination technology with embryonic stem cells to obtain embryonic stem cells with specific mutations, which are then introduced into recipient embryos. After the mutation embryonic stem cells differentiate into germ cells, the mutation can be passed on to offspring, ultimately obtaining stable and heritable mutant mouse strains. This method allows for the creation of animal models with complex editing strategies or large inserted fragments. The technology is mature and not limited by patents, but it has relatively low efficiency, long operation cycles, and higher costs. The company also uses guide RNA specific to the target site to guide the Cas9 nuclease to cut the genome. Non-homologous end joining can lead to fragment deletion, while homologous recombination can integrate exogenous fragments into specific sites in the genome. This method is easy to design and construct, has a short cycle, and low cost, making it the most widely used gene editing technology. However, it has some difficulties in modifying large fragments and requires patent licensing for commercial use. By using these technologies alone or in combination, the company designs different gene editing and breeding strategies to obtain genetically modified and stably heritable experimental animal mouse models. The company currently has over 16,000 commercialized animal model mouse strains as of the end of 2020. For mouse strains with high market demand, they are sold as live animals or in stock. For mouse strains with low usage, genetic material is cryopreserved and supplied through embryo recovery when needed, which can alleviate the occupancy rate of experimental mice and reduce operating costs. The company has also launched the ""Spot Mouse Program"" to meet the market demand for gene knockout mouse models in the field of life science research. The program aims to pre-construct a library of knockout and conditional knockout mouse strains for all 20,000 protein-coding genes in mice, providing a faster delivery time of 7 days and reducing costs for customers. 2.

539	Shenlian Biomedical (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft)	High-end equipment	The company's main product is the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccine for pigs. Since becoming the first company in China to successfully industrialize the synthesis of FMD peptide vaccines in 2007, the company has continued to increase its research and development efforts. Based on changes in the FMD epidemic situation, the company has continuously upgraded its products. It has developed a series of vaccines including the pig FMD type O synthetic peptide vaccine, pig FMD type O synthetic peptide vaccine (peptide 2570+7309), pig FMD type O synthetic peptide vaccine (peptide 2600+2700+2800), pig FMD type O and A bivalent synthetic peptide vaccine (peptide 2700+2800+MM13), and pig FMD type O and A bivalent inactivated vaccine (Re-O/MYA98/JSCZ/2013 strain + Re-A/WH/09 strain). The pig FMD type O synthetic peptide vaccine has been replaced by the pig FMD type O synthetic peptide vaccine (peptide 2570+7309) due to changes in the FMD epidemic strain. The pig FMD type O synthetic peptide vaccine (peptide 2570+7309) has been replaced by the pig FMD type O synthetic peptide vaccine (peptide 2600+2700+2800) due to changes in the FMD epidemic strain. Currently, the company is still producing and selling the pig FMD type O synthetic peptide vaccine (peptide 2600+2700+2800) and the pig FMD type O and A bivalent synthetic peptide vaccine (peptide 2700+2800+MM13) to meet the current epidemic prevention needs. The production line has passed the GMP static acceptance and is currently in the trial production stage. After mass production, it will be produced and sold in parallel. The three types of pig FMD type O synthetic peptide vaccines produced by the company are mutually substitutable. The previously produced pig FMD type O synthetic peptide vaccine and pig FMD type O synthetic peptide vaccine (peptide 2570+7309) are no longer produced and sold due to product updates. The currently produced and sold products of the company, pig FMD type O synthetic peptide vaccine (peptide 2600+2700+2800) and pig FMD type O and A bivalent synthetic peptide vaccine (peptide 2700+2800+MM13), can meet the epidemic prevention needs of different customer groups. In the future, after the mass production of the pig FMD type O and A bivalent inactivated vaccine (Re-O/MYA98/JSCZ/2013 strain + Re-A/WH/09 strain), it will be produced and sold in parallel with the existing two products to meet the needs of different customer groups. The company has a veterinary GMP certificate (Certificate No. 09029 for Veterinary Drug Production in 2017), which covers the production line of FMD synthetic peptide vaccines. The above production line can produce all types of FMD synthetic peptide vaccines. The production process of the series of pig FMD synthetic peptide vaccine products developed by the company is basically the same, and they can be produced using the above production line without the need for reconstruction or renovation for new products. The iteration of products will not have a significant adverse impact on the company's fixed asset investment and will not accelerate the depreciation and impairment of existing assets. In addition, the company's product, pig FMD type O and A bivalent inactivated vaccine (Re-O/MYA98/JSCZ/2013 strain + Re-A/WH/09 strain), has obtained a national first-class new veterinary drug registration certificate. The production line has passed the GMP static acceptance in February 2019 and is currently in the trial production stage, requiring dynamic acceptance through the GMP production line. After obtaining the GMP certificate, the company can apply for the production approval number for the product. The above production line can be used for all types of FMD inactivated vaccines. After the mass production and sale of the company's pig FMD type O and A bivalent inactivated vaccine, it will be produced and sold in parallel with the existing two products. The pig FMD type O and A bivalent inactivated vaccine and the pig FMD type O and A bivalent synthetic peptide vaccine are both used to prevent pig type O and A FMD, while the pig FMD type O synthetic peptide vaccine is only used to prevent pig type O FMD. The pig FMD inactivated vaccine and synthetic peptide vaccine produced by the company have their own characteristics. The pig FMD synthetic peptide vaccine has strong targeted protection against epidemic strains and is more precise, while the pig FMD inactivated vaccine has strong cross-protection and a good spectrum. The company's pig FMD vaccine products can meet the current epidemic prevention needs for pig FMD. In 2019, some provincial (municipal, autonomous region, and direct-controlled municipality) animal epidemic prevention authorities have tendered for the pig FMD type O vaccine, pig FMD type O and A bivalent inactivated vaccine, and pig FMD type O and A bivalent synthetic peptide vaccine. In addition, animal epidemic prevention authorities in various provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions, and direct-controlled municipalities) currently separately tender for FMD synthetic peptide vaccines and FMD inactivated vaccines. The future production of the pig FMD type O and A bivalent inactivated vaccine by the company will not replace the existing pig FMD synthetic peptide vaccine. In summary, after the mass production and sale of the pig FMD type O and A bivalent inactivated vaccine (Re-O/MYA98/JSCZ/2013 strain + Re-A/WH/09 strain), it will not have a significant adverse impact on the company's existing vaccine products, there will be no transitional period for product updates, and it will not have a significant adverse impact on the company's production and operation.

546	Beijing Yiheng Chuangyuan Technology Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft)	High-end equipment	After more than ten years of continuous investment and accumulation, Memblaze has formed three major technical solution sets: Memspeed (performance improvement), Memsolid (reliability improvement), and enterprise-level feature-specific technologies. These solutions have been continuously optimized and upgraded, enabling the large-scale deployment of the company's enterprise-level SSD products in the data center market. Based on this foundation, in recent years, the company has focused on building a firmware development system with the MUFP (Memblaze Unified Firmware Platform) unified architecture platform as the core. This has effectively improved the speed of firmware development, shortened product development cycles, and provided a solid technical foundation for the company's rapid development. 1) MUFP unified architecture platform: The MUFP unified architecture platform is the core platform for firmware development. The company modularizes the firmware development process through the MUFP unified architecture platform, improving the reusability and testability of firmware code, enhancing development efficiency, and significantly shortening product development cycles. In addition, the MUFP unified architecture platform integrates the company's core technologies, enabling flexible invocation and configuration of core technology modules, and providing products with richer enterprise-level features. The MemSpeed technology solution is a technical solution system that improves the performance of enterprise-level SSD products. This solution allows firmware to fully schedule hardware and leverage hardware performance to meet end users' demands for high-performance enterprise-level SSDs in terms of read/write speed, read/write latency, concurrent processing capability, and consistent QoS (Quality of Service). It optimizes PCIe interface latency, shortens the processing logic of the controller chip, and improves the processing frequency of the controller chip. It also enhances the NAND Flash interface rate to comprehensively improve SSD read/write performance. By using a multi-core architecture, different cores handle different functions, coordinating with each other to improve SSD's concurrent processing capability, achieve higher IOPS performance per watt, and improve the energy utilization efficiency of storage systems. To accommodate different flash memory vendors' differentiated flash interface standards, enhanced Flash channel programmable multi-core processor technology is used to support different interface standards, achieving higher-level functions such as latency reduction. Through dynamic smoothing and other technologies, it balances front-end read/write input and back-end garbage collection, reducing performance fluctuations during read/write processes and ensuring the consistency of QoS (including read/write bandwidth, IOPS, latency, etc.). By implementing a well-designed task scheduling mechanism for SSDs, different types of requests are prioritized to ensure timely processing of different read/write requests and prevent information flow congestion. The MemSolid technology solution is a technical solution system that guarantees the reliability of enterprise-level SSDs, further improving product lifespan and ensuring the reliability of the product lifecycle. It provides NAND Flash data error correction capability through low-density parity check (LDPC) coding technology, correcting data read/write errors in the event of NAND Flash bad blocks. By adding data protection information as metadata at the server host or SSD controller chip, it ensures data consistency from the host to the device, avoiding silent errors. To prevent data loss caused by power failure, it continuously monitors SSD power supply voltage, quickly saving cache data in power outage or hot-plug scenarios to avoid data loss caused by abnormal power interruption. The RAID technology further provides data protection at the NAND Flash Die (a smaller component of NAND Flash) level, achieving more precise data protection. By combining well-designed temperature protection logic with high-precision temperature sensors, it achieves automatic temperature warning, providing timely alerts when overheating is detected. Through stepless speed regulation technology, device performance smoothly and quickly reduces to a reasonable range, preventing severe performance fluctuations of SSD read/write and avoiding further temperature rise that may damage the device. 4) Enterprise-level feature-specific technical solutions: In addition to meeting the requirements of high performance and high reliability, enterprise-level SSDs also need to provide a variety of optional enterprise-level features to enhance product usability, improve product competitiveness, and provide better user experience, thereby increasing customer loyalty. These features include firmware upgrade without cold server restart, providing additional metadata beyond the standard sector size of 512 bytes to achieve data protection and additional storage space, persistent logging of various events on the SSD to help users locate various abnormal events, delay statistics and high-delay printing to analyze abnormal performance in business scenarios, support for 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) hardware encryption to protect user static data storage in case of theft, loss, or unauthorized access, bandwidth management for multiple namespaces to partition SSD capacity and specify the highest performance each namespace can use, etc. Enterprise-level SSD hardware solutions: Hardware is the foundation for implementing the functions of enterprise-level SSDs and the carrier of firmware. Hardware design is an important technical guarantee for achieving high reliability and long-term fault-free operation of enterprise-level SSDs. Based on the actual needs of enterprise-level SSD customers, Memblaze has accumulated its own technology in hardware design, engineering, testing, etc., and successfully applied it to product development. Software and hardware verification is an important link from solution design to mass production, and it is a crucial guarantee for determining whether a product can be sold and deployed on a large scale. The company's self-developed unified test verification platform has the characteristics of easy deployment, seamless script migration, strong versatility, and high reliability. The XT system supports multi-drive line-speed functional testing, performance testing, high and low-temperature cycling, etc., and has been widely used in environmental stress testing, research and development reliability testing, and mass production reliability testing, mainly used in product development settlement. The FT system is a testing system specifically developed for mass production testing needs. Its structure and form are customized according to the requirements of production testing, with high concurrency, high testing efficiency, strong management functions, and easy maintenance. It is mainly used in the product mass production stage. Enterprise-level SSDs have extremely demanding requirements for power supply, especially in terms of power failure protection. PBlaze5 adopts integrated microcontroller technology to realize separate power supply system management, which can comprehensively monitor the power supply, monitor the health of internal capacitors, and manage power failure. It can effectively respond to abnormal power fluctuations in server host systems. PBlaze6 further saves space while ensuring high reliability by using integrated power management circuits. The high performance of enterprise-level SSDs results in higher power consumption, which in turn increases the temperature and affects the usability of SSDs. The company's specialized hard disk air duct design greatly optimizes the traditional closed design of the cooling air duct, ensuring temperature measurement and control of SSDs under any working conditions, and guaranteeing the usability of SSDs. Complete system simulation and verification: The main components of SSDs, including NAND Flash, controller chips, and DRAM, are all packaged in BGA (Ball Grid Array) packaging technology, which does not have exposed pins, making testing more challenging. In addition, these hardware components have high signal rates, resulting in hundreds of high-speed signals inside the SSD, making it impossible to achieve complete test coverage. Based on the simulation function of EDA tools, the company conducts signal quality simulation and power integrity simulation of the entire board, and compares the test results of individual nodes with the simulation results to ensure the signal reliability of the entire system. Enterprise-level SSD design solutions involve multiple stages, including architecture design, firmware design and development, hardware design and development, component selection, verification and simulation, etc. The design and verification process is complex and requires high technical expertise. In addition, some users have special requirements for SSD functionality, specifications, performance, and form factor, requiring SSD manufacturers to provide customized design and development. During the reporting period, the company signed technology development service agreements with customers, providing them with product design services based on their specific requirements. Customers pay technology development fees to the company. After the completion of technology development, the company owns the intellectual property rights of the technology development achievements, while the customers have the right to use the commissioned technology development achievements.

In the service layer, the company builds various applications to support various typical application scenarios (such as personnel management, hierarchical early warning applications, smart security communities, and epidemic control applications), realizing the business application of various resource libraries in the software data layer.The principle of fusion computing for products is as follows:To achieve various typical applications (such as personnel management, smart security communities, etc.), it is necessary to grasp various different-dimensional feature information. However, there is a lack of correlation between various types of information. To solve the problem of information isolation, data fusion products perform fusion computing on different types of data according to the temporal-spatial dimension and feature dimension, resulting in various correlation relationships. The data sources processed by fusion computing include real-time collected data, social data, and public security data. After data cleaning, transformation, and storage, fusion computing is performed. A. For real-time collected dynamic data, collision, association, and co-location correlation calculations are used to form dynamic data correlation relationships. Known conditions are used to find two or more sets of data for cross-comparison using computer technology, and the intersection data generated from this is analyzed and identified. Known feature information is used to obtain feature information of peers through trajectory analysis. For multiple feature information, related normalization is performed based on the co-location algorithm. Different feature information is matched according to certain labels to form a network relationship with a specific label as the trust root. B. For social data and public security data, feature matching is performed based on a specific label as the trust root to form static data correlation relationships. C. The dynamic data correlation relationships and static data correlation relationships are matched and combined to form a feature profile database, providing data support for business applications. It can detect and warn when specific individuals enter specific areas. It can detect and warn abnormal behaviors of specific individuals, such as frequent entry into specific areas or gatherings of people.

It integrates abnormal detection and alarm in the community, such as fire perception and entry of specific individuals into the community. It can control and warn specific area elements and specific individuals. It can discover individuals related to specific individuals' trajectories, such as tracking contacts of epidemic cases. Taking the application of data fusion products in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic as an example, in various grassroots units fighting against the epidemic, due to the isolation of various data in the early stage, it was difficult to discover and manage people in epidemic areas. Even with a large amount of grassroots manpower, there were still many management loopholes. In order to continuously consolidate the phased achievements in the fight against the epidemic, the analysis of cross-domain personnel using multi-dimensional data fusion technology has become a normal demand during the epidemic. The analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic relies on core technologies such as trajectory data identity estimation and verification, and combines various industry data for model design, greatly improving the accuracy of early warning. In addition, by connecting with smart security community data, it provides accurate information for the normal management of communities during the epidemic. With wireless network data collection products as the foundation, data fusion products as the focus, and a nationwide service system as the guarantee, the company has provided security services for large domestic and international conferences such as the ""Two Sessions,"" the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and the China International Import Expo.The main components of the company's main business income are as follows: During the reporting period, the proportion of revenue from mobile data collection products accounted for 95.48% of the total operating income.

In the field of plastic regeneration, the company uses advanced plastic regeneration technology to produce regenerated materials from renewable plastics. In the field of recycled plastic utilization, the company uses advanced plastic multi-layer co-extrusion technology to produce recycled plastic products, achieving high-value utilization. The company has obtained 10 national authorized invention patents, and 2 projects have been recognized as national Torch Program industrialization demonstration projects. Some of the company's core technologies have been identified as internationally advanced through scientific and technological achievements appraisal organized by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The company and its subsidiaries, Shanghai Yingke, Lu'an Yingke, and Zhenjiang Yingke, are all high-tech enterprises and have established multiple provincial and municipal research and development platforms. The company has formulated 1 industry standard, participated in the formulation of 2 national standards and 1 group standard. After years of operation, the company has accumulated high-quality customer resources with stable raw material supply channels, international advanced core technology, strong technological innovation capabilities, novel and fashionable product design concepts, and strict quality requirements. It has become a global leading enterprise in PS plastic recycling with its unique PS recycling model. The company is continuously developing plastic recycling solutions and is currently constructing a 50,000-ton/year PET recycling and regeneration project in Malaysia. The project has completed the production equipment, research and development testing instrument selection, and installation and commissioning of some equipment. In the future, the company will also expand its recycling and regeneration business for various plastics such as PE and PP, continuously expanding the categories of recycled plastics. The company's main products are as follows: Currently, the company has formed three main business categories: recycling, regeneration, and utilization, covering the complete vertical industrial chain of PS plastic recycling. Based on the main production of recycled PS plastics, the company has horizontally expanded its business to include the recycling and utilization of various plastics such as recycled PET, PE, and PP. In the field of plastic recycling, the company collects renewable plastics from domestic and foreign sources, which is the ""reduction"" link in the recycling economy of renewable plastics. Currently, the company purchases renewable PS plastics from more than 400 renewable plastic recycling enterprises worldwide, forming a renewable PS plastic recycling network covering domestic and international markets. The plastics recycled by Yingke Environmental Protection are mainly PS foam plastics. PS foam plastics are produced by styrene suspension polymerization, adding foaming agents, and undergoing processes such as pre-expansion, maturation, molding, drying, and cutting. PS foam plastics are mainly used for the production of plastic foam packaging boxes for household appliances and electronic components, plastic foam preservation boxes for food transportation, and building insulation materials, among others. In the recycling process of PS foam plastics, there are difficulties such as large volume, low density, scattered recycling points, and high transportation costs. To address these challenges, the company has independently developed energy-saving and efficient foam volume reduction machines. This equipment adopts integrated control mode, with high production efficiency and continuous automatic operation. It crushes or thermally melts PS foam plastics, uniformly increases the density, and forms foam blocks or cakes. Without changing the physical properties of PS, it closes the gaps in the foam plastics, expels the air in the gaps, and can reduce the low-density, large-volume PS foam plastics to one-fiftieth of their original volume (compressed by foam cold press) or one-ninetieth of their original volume (melted and densified by foam hot melt machine), while maintaining the physical properties of PS. This significantly reduces logistics costs such as storage and transportation and enables the centralized and efficient recycling of renewable PS foam plastics from around the world. Recycling points can purchase the company's recycling equipment, which not only greatly improves recycling efficiency and reduces recycling and transportation costs but also allows them to sell the compressed PS foam plastics to the company. By selling recycling equipment, the company not only obtains profits from equipment sales but also establishes long-term cooperative relationships with recycling points, which helps the company obtain stable raw material sources, achieving a win-win business purpose and forming a positive interactive model. Renewable plastics refer to various plastics generated in the process of social production and consumption that have lost all or part of their original value and can be recycled, processed, and treated to regain their value and bring economic benefits. In contrast, ""waste plastics"" refer to narrow-sense ""scrap plastics."" The renewable PS purchased by the issuer is high-quality and pure PS foam/cake blocks. In addition to PS plastics, the company is investing in the construction of a 50,000-ton/year PET recycling and regeneration project in Malaysia. PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) is a highly crystalline thermoplastic resin mainly used for manufacturing packaging boxes, beverage bottles, textiles, etc. The company has reserved PET recycling equipment technology and, once completed, will recycle renewable PET plastics mainly from PET beverage bottles on the existing global recycling network. The company has developed various recycling equipment suitable for different scenarios, including A-series foam cold press machines, Z-series foam compression machines, M-series foam hot melt machines, and P-series volume reduction and dewatering machines. These machines are used for processing different types of foam plastics such as EPS, EPP, and EPE. The company's PS foam volume reduction machine has been applied in pilot cities for domestic waste classification and recycling, such as Shanghai, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Suzhou. Multiple ""two-network integration"" sites in these cities have purchased and used the company's PS foam volume reduction machines, and the company purchases compressed PS foam blocks from these sites. With the promotion of domestic waste classification, the company's recycling model has been successfully applied in China, which helps promote the growth of domestic recycling scale and the efficiency of nearby recycling. In the field of plastic regeneration, the company uses regenerated granulation technology to turn used plastics into regenerated plastic particles, which become industrial raw materials and are the ""resource"" link in the recycling economy of regenerated plastics. The recycled PS plastics, after pre-treatment such as fine crushing and automated impurity separation, are processed through extrusion, fine filtration, evaporation exhaust, and integrated granulation processes using molecular chain repair technology and plastic modification technology. The company produces regenerated PS particles. Currently, a portion of the regenerated PS particles produced by the company is directly sold to downstream plastic product companies, while another portion is used to produce recycled plastic products for its own use. The high-quality regenerated PS particles produced by the company have reached the level of new materials in performance indicators such as melt index, impact strength, tensile strength, elongation at break, flexural strength, and flexural modulus. They have a lower cost than new material particles and have a cost advantage, making them partially replaceable in applications that traditionally use new materials. The company produces high-end regenerated PS particles with a purity of up to 99%, high molecular weight, and can be recycled multiple times. In the field of recycled plastic utilization, the company uses advanced plastic multi-layer co-extrusion technology to produce recycled plastic products, which is the ""reuse"" link in the recycling economy of recycled plastics. The company uses its own regenerated PS particles as raw materials and applies micro-foaming double-layer or multi-layer co-extrusion technology to produce double-layer or multi-layer line products through processes such as embossing and thermal transfer. The company's line products can be divided into frame line and decorative line, with frame line used for the production of picture frames, photo frames, and mirror frames, and decorative line used as skirting line, corner line, and waistline for architectural decoration. The company's line products are environmentally friendly, as they are made from recycled and regenerated PS particles that can be recycled. They do not contain harmful substances such as formaldehyde, ammonia, benzene, and heavy metals, meet the 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) standard, protect the ecological environment, and achieve a circular economy. The line products have the characteristics of waterproof, moisture-proof, mildew-proof, corrosion-resistant, insect-proof, and termite-proof, and are less prone to deformation and deterioration compared to wood materials. The company adopts a fashionable and innovative design concept, coupled with a rich variety of molds and advanced surface treatment processes, continuously breaking through consumers' perception of PS line products. The company not only replaces wood, stone, and metal with plastic but also surpasses the limitations of wood, stone, and metal line products in terms of design and processing, enabling flexible production of various styles and small batches. Picture frames and mirror frames are indispensable fashionable elements in home decoration, especially picture frames and mirror frames that are often used in various forms such as background walls and photo walls in the field of home soft furnishings. Traditional picture frames and mirror frames are mostly made of wood, resulting in a waste of forest resources. Compared to traditional wooden frames, recycled plastic frames have the characteristics of wear resistance, corrosion resistance, and simpler and more stable surface treatment processes. This process of turning waste into treasure breaks the production tradition of wooden frames and improves production efficiency. With the maturity of environmentally friendly finished frames, the company's production of environmentally friendly finished frames has further developed based on the original imitation wood, imitation stone, and imitation metal. The appearance design of the frames is more diverse, and the material texture is more realistic. The company's picture frames, mirror frames, and finished frames have been recognized by international large-scale retailers and decoration businesses. The products are sold to the high-end home decoration markets in multiple countries and regions worldwide. The company's 50,000-ton/year PET recycling and regeneration project includes the production of high-quality r-PET sheets using recycled PET flakes as raw materials through solid-phase bonding and multi-layer co-extrusion technology. PET sheets have the characteristics of splash resistance and high light transmittance. During the COVID-19 pandemic, based on the company's long-term research and accumulation of PET material applications and processing technology, the company quickly responded to the surge in demand for disposable protective face masks and eye masks by temporarily developing products using PET sheets as the main material. The disposable protective face masks are mainly made of PET plastic sheets, with accessories including foam strips, elastic bands, labels, and protective films. The company's products include disposable protective face masks and disposable protective eye masks, with the latter being a smaller production volume and collectively referred to as disposable protective face masks. In April 2020, the company entered into a related party transaction contract with Yingke Medical, an affiliated party, to manufacture disposable protective face masks on its behalf. This business was generated due to the surge in demand for disposable protective face masks caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic overseas and the company's ability and necessity to rapidly produce disposable protective face masks. The PET plastic sheets used in this business are sourced externally. The company's production of disposable protective face masks is exclusively supplied to Yingke Medical. This business is not sustainable and does not constitute core technology income. The business was terminated in December 2020, and the issuer has committed not to produce this product in the future."

"During the reporting period, the company's main products were permanent magnet synchronous motors, servo motors, servo drives, controllers, and new energy electric drive systems, which are applied in the motion control system industry and the new energy vehicle industry. 1. Motion control system products: Industrial automation control systems are systems that achieve production and process automation through the application of industrial automation control technology. The level of development of industrial automation control systems is an indicator of a country's level of industrial development. Industrial automation control systems can be roughly divided into four layers: network layer, control layer, drive layer, and execution layer (including feedback layer). Examples of products in each layer include industrial Ethernet, industrial wireless routers, switches, servo drives, frequency converters, stepper drives, servo motors, direct drive motors, asynchronous motors, sensors, measurement and instrumentation, etc. The motion control system is one of the core components of industrial automation control systems and is usually composed of three parts: the control layer, which plans the motion trajectory and adjusts it in real time based on feedback information; the drive layer, which amplifies the weak current from the controller into a strong current for the operating unit; and the execution layer, which drives the mechanical work through the operation of the executing unit (such as a servo motor). At the same time, sensors transmit real-time information from the executing unit to the control layer. In the industry, the executing layer's servo motor and feedback device, and the drive layer's servo drive, are commonly referred to as a servo system. The performance of the servo motor as the control motor in the servo system determines the performance of the motion control system in terms of position, speed, and torque control. The company's products cover the control layer, drive layer, and execution layer of the motion control system, making it one of the few enterprises in the industry with a relatively complete overall solution and products.U series AC permanent magnet synchronous servo motors: These motors have a high torque/volume ratio and power/volume ratio, low inertia, high rigidity, good motion stability performance, and a maximum output power of 350 kW. The torque range is 0.2 Nm to 2,000 Nm. They are used in CNC machine tools, plastic machinery, aerospace, packaging machinery, etc.E series AC permanent magnet servo motors: These motors have higher power density, better servo response speed, overload output characteristics, and forced air cooling. They are used in aerospace, packaging machinery, etc.TK series permanent magnet synchronous direct drive torque servo motors: These motors are directly driven, have high torque, high speed, and are frameless with separate stators and rotors, suitable for integration into equipment. They have extremely high torque density and peak torque density, high-speed operation, and weak magnetic speed control capability. The constant power range can reach 10:1, and the torque can reach 40,000 Nm. They are used in CNC machine tools, plastic machinery, and the energy field.TW series integrated intelligent servo motors: These motors have high integration, large power density, and small size. They support communication via the CanOpen or EtherCAT bus. They are used in CNC machine tools, plastic machinery, and the energy field.AxN series digital AC servo drives: These drives are suitable for various fieldbuses such as CANopen, EtherCAT, RS232/422/485, and support various mainstream encoders. They are used in plastic machinery, wind power, robots, textile machinery, packaging and printing, etc. They have high-precision drive torque compensation technology, reducing torque fluctuations of high-torque low-speed motors to ±1% at 2 rpm.PH300 high-performance closed-loop vector drives: These drives support closed-loop vector control, Modbus communication protocol, fast current limiting function, strong overload capacity, and have functions such as output phase loss protection, overcurrent/overvoltage/overload/overheat protection, etc.AxN series DC bus multi-axis drives: These drives are controlled directly by an internal PLC, with fast execution speed and support for five PLC programming languages for secondary development.

Main products in the new energy vehicle industry: The new energy vehicle electric drive system belongs to the broad field of industrial automation control. However, because the new energy vehicle electric drive system is directly applied to new energy vehicles, and new energy vehicles are a large industry with emerging industry attributes, the industry generally separates new energy vehicle-related products from motion control industry-related products. The new energy vehicle electric drive system, also known as the powertrain, consists of three major components: the drive motor, motor controller, and transmission device. During the operation of a new energy vehicle, the vehicle controller detects the throttle and brake signals and sends torque commands to the motor controller. The motor controller controls the voltage and current of the drive motor to control the torque of the drive motor. Finally, the transmission device transmits the power output by the motor to achieve the start, stop, and speed change of the new energy vehicle. The electric drive system of new energy vehicles, as a functional replacement for traditional engines and transmissions, directly determines the main performance indicators such as climbing ability, acceleration, and maximum speed of electric vehicles, and is a core component of new energy vehicles. It converts the electrical energy of the power battery into rotating mechanical energy, which is the source of power output. It controls the power output of the drive motor. It is also known as the ""reducer"" and reduces the output speed and increases the output torque through a gear set to ensure that the drive system operates continuously in the high-efficiency range. The new energy vehicle electric drive system products are one of the company's main products and have been widely used in new energy passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, etc. The ""all-in-one"" electric drive system is integrated to achieve high performance, low cost, lightweight, and space-saving features. It has an output torque range of 1,200 Nm to 4,000 Nm, covering 40 kW to 220 kW, meeting the requirements of various passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles from A00 to B level. It has excellent slot-pole matching, a multi-layer magnetic steel structure, fine skewed pole design to reduce demagnetization risk, water-cooled stator housing combined with epoxy sealing of the stator, optimized thermal management, and multi-objective optimization methods to improve motor efficiency and NVH performance. It covers passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles, meeting the control requirements of A00 to B level passenger vehicles and commercial vehicle electric drive systems.

Polycrystalline silicon is a form of elemental silicon. It is a silver-gray, metallic-looking crystal that is a non-metallic material with a certain level of purity after being purified through a series of physical and chemical reactions using industrial silicon as raw material. Polycrystalline silicon has semiconductor properties and is the basic material for a wide range of semiconductor products used in contemporary applications such as artificial intelligence, automatic control, information processing, and optoelectronic conversion. Depending on the purity requirements and different uses, polycrystalline silicon can be divided into solar-grade polycrystalline silicon and electronic-grade polycrystalline silicon. Solar-grade polycrystalline silicon is mainly used in the production of solar cells, while electronic-grade polycrystalline silicon is widely used in the field of electronic information. Solar power generation has unique characteristics such as abundant reserves, safety and reliability, no pollution, and wide distribution, and is widely regarded as the best choice for solving a series of major problems such as energy crisis and environmental issues. Since the advent of solar cells, silicon materials have become the main materials for solar cells due to their high reserves, mature processes, cleanliness, high conversion efficiency, and stable performance. Currently, the photovoltaic industry is the largest consumer of polycrystalline silicon. According to data from the China Photovoltaic Industry Association, the global production of polycrystalline silicon in 2019 was 508,000 tons, of which solar-grade chunk silicon accounted for approximately 458,000 tons, or about 90.1%. Solar-grade polycrystalline silicon has strict requirements for impurities, usually requiring a total impurity content of less than 10-6, which means that the purity of polycrystalline silicon needs to reach above 99.9999%, especially the requirements for boron and phosphorus elements are particularly strict. The preparation of high-purity polycrystalline silicon is a technologically advanced process in the photovoltaic industry chain. Solar-grade polycrystalline silicon can be classified as follows: (1) According to the different downstream production of silicon wafers, polycrystalline silicon can be divided into materials for monocrystalline silicon wafers and materials for polycrystalline silicon wafers. Materials for monocrystalline silicon wafers refer to polycrystalline silicon used for monocrystalline silicon pulling and production of monocrystalline silicon wafers, while materials for polycrystalline silicon wafers refer to polycrystalline silicon used for polycrystalline ingot casting and production of polycrystalline silicon wafers. (2) According to the different impurities and conductivity types in polycrystalline silicon, it can be divided into P-type and N-type. When silicon is doped with donor impurities (Group V elements such as phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, etc.) as the main impurities, it is mainly electron-conductive and is N-type polycrystalline silicon. When silicon is doped with acceptor impurities (Group III elements such as boron, aluminum, gallium, etc.) as the main impurities, it is mainly hole-conductive and is P-type polycrystalline silicon. (3) According to the differences in technical indicators, solar-grade polycrystalline silicon can be divided into four grades: special grade, grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3. (4) According to whether customers can directly use it for smelting, polycrystalline silicon can be divided into wash-free materials and non-wash-free materials. Wash-free materials can be directly used for smelting after inspection, while non-wash-free materials need to go through sorting, grinding, cleaning, and other processes before use. (5) According to the different surface quality of polycrystalline silicon, it can be further divided into dense material, cauliflower material, coral material, etc. (6) According to the shape, it can be divided into block and rod. During the reporting period, the proportion of materials for monocrystalline silicon wafers in the company's products has been increasing year by year, and currently, the production volume of materials for monocrystalline silicon wafers accounts for about 95% of the total production volume.

Therefore, the lithium battery protection chip is an important component of safety-related products, and its performance and reliability have a direct impact on end products. The lithium battery protection chip is composed of a control IC, MOSFET, and peripheral components. The control IC monitors the battery voltage and current. When there is overcharging and discharging, the controller controls the MOSFET to cut off and restore the circuit to protect the battery. The main functions of the lithium battery protection chip are overcharging protection, over-discharge protection, overcurrent and short circuit protection, and over-temperature protection. Its main function in electronic devices is to reduce the risk of battery damage, explosion, or shortened lifespan due to overcharging, over-discharging, over-temperature, or overcurrent. 2. Power management chip. The power management chip is the central and hub of electronic product power supply, responsible for the transformation, distribution, detection, and other control functions of the required electrical energy, and is an important component of the operation of electronic products. In daily life, the power supply from the power grid is usually AC power, while the internal power supply of electronic products is usually DC power, so it is necessary to convert AC power to DC power (i.e., AC-DC). The internal structure of electronic products consists of many modules with different functions, and each module requires different power supply voltages. Therefore, the power management chip is needed to perform boost and buck conversions (i.e., DC-DC) to convert and regulate the voltage provided by the battery to the desired voltage value. The company's power management chips mainly include DC-DC chips (including DC-DC buck series, DC-DC boost series), charging chips, LDO, and SoC series.'

74	Suzhou Weichuang Electric Technology Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft for Review)	New materials	The company's main business is the research and development, production, and sales of products such as inverters, servo systems, and motion controllers. 1) Categories of the company's inverter products. The company's self-developed and produced inverter products are mainly divided into general-purpose inverters and industry-specific machines. Among them, general-purpose inverters mainly include the AC300, AC200, AC70, AC10 series, with voltage levels ranging from 220V to 3,300V AC and power ranges from 0.4kW to 1,200kW.

Introduction to Application Scenarios:(1) Air Purification in the Semiconductor Industry: The semiconductor industry is a strategically supported industry in the country, and the precision and cleanliness requirements of its production lines and plants are very high. It requires an efficient air purification system to ensure production yield and slow down the aging of production equipment. As an important supplier to large domestic chip and LCD panel manufacturers, the company provides air purification products that meet clean requirements, high efficiency, low energy consumption, and low noise for these industries. Cleanrooms are an important part of the semiconductor industry manufacturing process and directly determine the success or failure of the final product. Modern integrated circuit manufacturing processes have reached the 5-nanometer level. The manufacturing process of integrated circuits generally starts from the automated software generating algorithm logic to hardware circuits, and then transfers the integrated circuit design layout to photomasks through lithography. The basic manufacturing material of integrated circuits is silicon wafers. After various surface treatments, the silicon wafers are combined with photomasks to undergo processes such as lithography, heat treatment, dielectric deposition, and chemical mechanical polishing to finally form integrated circuit chips. If the air cleanliness during the production process does not meet the requirements, the product yield will be greatly affected. With technological advancements, the cleanliness requirements for integrated circuits are increasing. Generally, when the particle size reaches half the size of the integrated circuit node, it becomes a destructive particle that affects the manufacturing process. For example, in the 14-nanometer process, 7-nanometer particles will affect the manufacturing process. As integrated circuit processes become higher, with the current development of 3-nanometer processes, the cleanliness required for the integrated circuit manufacturing process is increasing, placing higher demands on cleanroom engineering technology. Almost all major links in the integrated circuit industry chain, from single crystal silicon wafer manufacturing to IC manufacturing and packaging, need to be completed in cleanrooms with high cleanliness requirements. ② Application of Company Products: In order to maintain the cleanliness of cleanrooms, semiconductor cleanrooms usually adopt vertical unidirectional airflow to push out the polluted indoor air to the outside, thereby achieving the purpose of purifying indoor air. Air purification in cleanrooms is mainly divided into three stages: The first stage involves multiple levels of filtration of outdoor air through pre-filters, medium-efficiency filters, high-efficiency filters, and chemical filters in the air conditioning unit, gradually removing impurities, floating particles, particles larger than 0.3µm, and atmospheric chemical pollutants. The second stage involves the use of fan filter units and built-in (or matched) high-efficiency, ultra-high-efficiency filters, and chemical filters (when required by the process) to push stable clean laminar airflow into the cleanroom, purifying the air and achieving extremely high cleanliness standards. The third stage involves the return air from the cleanroom being sent back to the fan filter unit through raised floors and air supply ducts (or return air ducts), filtered through high-efficiency, ultra-high-efficiency filters, and chemical filters, and then re-supplied to the cleanroom for reuse. External air enters the internal circulation system of the cleanroom after passing through multi-level air filters (numbered 1 to 4) for step-by-step filtration. Then, through the fan filter unit, in combination with high-efficiency/ultra-high-efficiency filters and optional chemical filters (numbered 5, 6, 7), clean air is sent into the cleanroom in a stable laminar flow, maintaining the cleanliness of the working area through the continuous operation of the fan filter unit. In specific equipment or areas with higher cleanliness requirements, further air purification is achieved inside the cleanroom through purification tents combined with EFUs (numbered 8, 9), reaching a higher level of cleanliness. (2) Air Purification in the Biopharmaceutical Industry: In the biopharmaceutical industry, various levels of filters produced by the company are used to protect the environment from particle and microbial contamination and achieve the required air cleanliness according to GMP specifications. The company provides ultra-clean solutions for local areas within cleanrooms, including ultra-thin equipment with built-in fan filter units (EFUs), effectively combining the cleanliness of the overall environment with the high-level cleanliness of specific local environments. In addition, the company's air purification equipment such as weighing hoods, laminar flow hoods, BIBO systems, etc., play an important role in maintaining air cleanliness, improving product yield, and achieving pollution-free emissions during the production process in the pharmaceutical industry. (3) Air Purification in Commercial Buildings: With years of experience, the company can recommend and provide suitable indoor air purification products and technical solutions according to customer needs, greatly improving indoor air quality. The company's various levels of air filters, air purification equipment, and other products are suitable for air filtration in HVAC systems, removing particulate matter (such as PM2.5), gaseous pollutants (such as formaldehyde, chemical gaseous pollutants, etc.), and have bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects, effectively maintaining the health of indoor personnel. (4) Atmospheric Environmental Governance: During industrial production and processing, pollutants such as oil mist, dust, and VOCs are generated. If not effectively treated, they can endanger human health and pollute the environment. The company provides treatment for different industrial exhaust gases and offers a series of environmental emission control products, including zeolite rotary module units, VOCs treatment systems, oil mist purification systems, industrial dust removal equipment, filter cartridge dust collectors, etc."	Advanced basic materials	1.

Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft for Review)	New materials	"The issuer's main business is the research, development, production, and sales of high-end electronic materials, focusing on providing high-end electronic materials and application solutions. The issuer's existing products include electromagnetic shielding film, conductive adhesive film, ultra-thin flexible copper-clad laminate, and ultra-thin copper foil, which are high-performance composite materials. Among them, electromagnetic shielding film is the main source of income for the issuer during the reporting period. The issuer's industry belongs to a strategic emerging industry. According to the ""Classification of Strategic Emerging Industries (2018)"" published by the National Bureau of Statistics, electromagnetic shielding film, ultra-thin flexible copper-clad laminate, and ultra-thin copper foil are all key products. During the reporting period, the issuer's main business did not undergo significant changes.Electromagnetic shielding film is a kind of electromagnetic shielding material, currently mainly used in key electronic components such as Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) and Flexible Printed Circuit (FPC) and related components. It is an important raw material for FPC and has a wide range of applications in the fields of electromagnetic shielding and absorption due to its excellent performance. PCB is a key electronic interconnection device for electronic products and is known as the ""mother of electronic products."" FPC is a type of PCB with high wiring density, lightweight, bendable, and suitable for three-dimensional assembly. It is suitable for miniaturized and lightweight electronic products and is widely used in modern electronic products such as smartphones, computers, wearable devices, automotive electronics, and 5G communication base stations.Conductive adhesive film is a connecting material that provides mechanical and electrical connections between electronic components and circuit boards. It is one of the important packaging materials for wireless communication terminals. Flexible copper-clad laminate is the processing substrate for FPC, composed of flexible insulation layers and metal foils, and is the core raw material for FPC. Ultra-thin copper foil is an important material for meeting high requirements of PCB. Electronic components generate electromagnetic waves during operation, which can cause electromagnetic interference with electronic components. With the development of modern electronic products, FPC tends to be high-frequency and high-speed, and the electromagnetic interference generated becomes more serious. Effective suppression of electromagnetic interference has become an important part of FPC products. Currently, the main measure for FPC electromagnetic shielding is to apply electromagnetic shielding film on its surface. Due to the characteristics of FPC being lightweight and bendable, high requirements are also placed on electromagnetic shielding film. In addition to meeting the requirements for electromagnetic shielding effectiveness, it also needs to be thin, flexible, have low grounding resistance, and high peel strength. Therefore, the production process of electromagnetic shielding film is complex and technically challenging.

The company's main business, main products, and services.	6006,3147,5061	4918,8493,211,9357,2268,7973,429,6960,1072,9319,4753,80,2074,7001,1859,2519,8409
474	Dragon Soaring Semiconductor Co., Ltd. Science and Technology Innovation Board Initial Public Offering Prospectus (Draft)	New materials	"(1) Power devices. The main function of power devices is power conversion and power control, serving as the energy supply center for various electronic devices. Power devices enable the conversion of AC and DC power, voltage conversion, and other power conversion functions, improving energy conversion efficiency. Additionally, power devices can also control circuit switches and reduce power loss. Power devices have a wide range of downstream applications, including consumer electronics, industrial electronics, automotive electronics, and military electronics. Different types of electronic devices require power devices with different functions and application methods, so the company needs to design power device products that are suitable for different application areas. The company has gradually formed four major product platforms: super junction MOSFET, planar MOSFET, trench gate shielded MOSFET, and trench MOSFET, with over 500 product models. These products are widely used in LED lighting drivers, power adapters, TV boards, battery management systems, communication power supplies, and military special power supplies. The company's power MOSFET products can be divided into two categories: wafer and packaged products. Wafers are products formed by processing circuit structures on silicon wafers. As a design-oriented enterprise in the semiconductor industry, the company mainly engages in chip circuit structure design. After a series of research and development design processes, product design documents containing core technologies are formed. The company provides the product design documents to wafer foundries, which then use manufacturing processes such as photolithography, etching, ion implantation, and backside thinning to process raw materials such as epitaxial wafers into wafers with specific circuit structure units that can achieve the intended design functions. Each independent unit on the wafer is a chip. After purchasing the company's chip products, some downstream customers combine them with other types of chips to form devices with specific functions, or they independently package them to create specific power devices. The company's super junction MOSFET, trench gate shielded MOSFET, and trench MOSFET chips are developed and designed based on an 8-inch wafer process platform, while the planar MOSFET chips are developed and designed based on a 6-inch wafer process platform. Note: A cell is the smallest repeating unit that makes up a chip. A chip consists of multiple cells connected in parallel. The image shows the cell structure of a super junction MOSFET. Packaged products refer to power devices that have been packaged, including chips, copper frames, plastic encapsulation shells, and leads. Among these structures, the chip is the core component that performs the main functions, while the copper frame, plastic encapsulation shell, and leads provide support, protection, heat dissipation, electrical isolation, and connection, allowing the power device to form a complete circuit system with other components. Before chip packaging, it is usually necessary to remove a certain thickness of excess substrate material from the backside of the wafer to improve heat dissipation and facilitate packaging. Backside metallization refers to depositing a layer of metal film on the backside of the thinned chip using physical vapor deposition, which can reduce thermal resistance and facilitate heat dissipation. Some power devices also have electrodes on the backside. The processes of wafer thinning and backside metallization are collectively referred to as ""backside thinning and metallization."" The company's various power MOSFET products differ in cell structure, electrical characteristics, and application areas. The company continuously reduces conduction and switching losses, improves product reliability, and enhances energy conversion efficiency through advanced design processes to meet different customer application requirements. The structural diagrams and application areas of the company's various products are shown in the table below: (Table not provided) The company's power MOSFET products are mainly used in various types of switch-mode power supplies. Their function is typically to convert input 220V AC power into low-voltage DC power such as 3.3V/5V/12V/48V, providing power for CPUs, mobile phones, laptops, communication devices, etc. As one of the switching devices, power MOSFETs decompose input energy into several energy packets at a higher operating frequency, reducing the size of components (inductors or capacitors) required to store and transport energy packets in each switching cycle, thereby continuously reducing the size of end products. Switch-mode power supplies generally consist of a high-voltage circuit, a low-voltage circuit, and a transformer. The high-voltage circuit requires high-voltage MOSFETs to withstand the high voltage after grid and line voltage boosting and ""disassemble"" it into high-frequency AC power. The low-voltage circuit requires medium to low-voltage MOSFETs to withstand the low voltage after transformer voltage reduction and convert high-frequency AC power into DC power. Therefore, the same end product may use different types of power MOSFET products. In the same voltage rating range, the selection of MOSFET product categories by the company's civilian customers is mainly based on the following four factors: 1. The larger the chip area on the same technology platform wafer, the higher the chip cost. On the same chip area, the more advanced the technology platform, the more complex the process, and the higher the chip cost. 2. Under the same voltage, the larger the current (power), the larger the chip area. Under the same voltage and current (power), the super junction MOSFET technology platform is more advanced, and the chip area is smaller compared to the planar MOSFET. However, due to the more complex production process, the chip cost varies. 3. Under the same voltage, the larger the current (power), the larger the chip area. Under the same voltage and current (power), the shielded gate trench MOSFET technology platform is more advanced, and the chip area is smaller compared to the trench MOSFET. However, due to the more complex production process, the chip cost varies. Therefore, under small current (power) conditions, planar MOSFET is more cost-effective for high-voltage MOSFETs, while under large current (power) conditions, super junction MOSFET is more cost-effective for high-voltage MOSFETs. Therefore, under small current (power) conditions, trench MOSFET is more cost-effective for medium to low-voltage MOSFETs, while under large current (power) conditions, shielded gate trench MOSFET is more cost-effective for medium to low-voltage MOSFETs. 4. Chip area and package size. Under the same voltage and current (power) conditions, the planar MOSFET chip area is larger than the super junction MOSFET, which may exceed the chip area range suitable for conventional packaging forms or fail to meet the requirements of circuit board layout. Under the same voltage and current (power) conditions, the trench MOSFET chip area is larger than the shielded gate trench MOSFET, which may exceed the chip area range suitable for conventional packaging forms or fail to meet the requirements of circuit board layout. Super junction MOSFET has lower conduction and switching losses compared to planar MOSFET, meeting the more stringent energy efficiency requirements of end products. Shielded gate trench MOSFET has lower conduction and switching losses compared to trench MOSFET, meeting the more stringent energy efficiency requirements of end products. Generally, planar MOSFET has better EMI characteristics than super junction MOSFET, making it more suitable for applications with special EMI requirements. For example, communication power supplies and mining power supplies have high power requirements, typically ranging from 1 kW to 5 kW, requiring large chip areas and high efficiency and heat dissipation. Super junction MOSFET can achieve a smaller chip area compared to planar MOSFET, making it more cost-effective while meeting higher efficiency and heat dissipation requirements. Therefore, 550V to 650V super junction MOSFETs are commonly used in high-voltage circuits. On the other hand, power adapters, which have power requirements of only 20W to 100W but have high EMI requirements, commonly use 600V to 800V planar MOSFETs in high-voltage circuits. The adoption of this product form for external sales is due to the following reasons. The company's wafer products are mainly used for chip encapsulation with customers' IC chips, suitable for low-power applications. Since power devices need to be used with control driver ICs, in low-power applications, the chip area is small, and encapsulation can save one packaging cost. Additionally, due to the small power, heat dissipation conditions are easily met. The company's packaged products are mainly used in applications with higher power and higher heat dissipation requirements. Military customers purchase the company's power device products mainly for the production of military special power supplies. Military products have very high reliability requirements and need devices that can operate normally in harsh environments such as high temperatures and low temperatures. Therefore, the company needs to conduct various tests and screenings on power devices to provide special power devices that meet the quality assurance levels of national military industry standards (referred to as ""national military standards"") for general military use. The majority of the company's special power devices are sold in packaged form. (2) System solutions. System solutions refer to the combination of power devices and other electronic components through circuit topologies, using appropriate control methods to create products that meet specific functional requirements. In the process of power device research, design, and application, the company understands the circuit topologies and power device parameter requirements of downstream products, enabling it to provide system solutions to customers. The company's power control cabin products consist of power systems composed of power devices and control systems composed of various digital chips, meeting the functional requirements of weapons and equipment. During the reporting period, the company's system solution business revenue mainly came from power control cabins. The company's power control cabin products can accurately simulate the actual operation of weapons and equipment, effectively meeting the needs of the military, and have high reliability, ensuring normal functionality in harsh environments such as high temperatures, low temperatures, and severe vibrations. In addition to power control cabins, the company also had a small amount of inverter sales during the reporting period. Inverters are one of the most important core components of photovoltaic power plants. They convert the DC power generated by the photovoltaic system into AC power for grid transmission using power electronic conversion technology. Power devices are one of the core components of inverters. In the early stages, the company conducted research and design on both power devices and inverters, acting as both the design party for power devices and the ""end user"" of power devices. This allowed the company to deeply understand the performance requirements of power devices in different application scenarios and the matching relationships with different components, and master a series of circuit topologies for power systems, control systems, and other systems. Subsequently, considering the strategic focus on concentrating research and development resources and strengthening the power MOSFET business, the company proactively adjusted its business direction and gradually reduced its involvement in the inverter business. In addition, the company plans to develop power module products based on customer demand, combining power devices with control driver chips, passive components, etc., to create products with functions such as AC-DC, DC-DC, and DC-AC. The company's power device business and system solution business complement each other, and the synergistic effect of these two businesses helps the company improve profitability, save costs, and reduce operational risks. Firstly, the power device business and system solution business have a upstream-downstream relationship. Power control cabins, inverters, power modules, and other products, as power devices, are used in system solutions. The company's understanding of downstream products' circuit topologies and power device parameter requirements enables it to provide system solutions to customers. Secondly, the system solution business can drive the demand for power devices. The company's system solution products, such as power control cabins, require power devices as core components. The demand for system solutions can drive the demand for power devices, promoting the development of the power device business. Thirdly, the power device business can provide technical support for the system solution business. The company's expertise in power device research, design, and application allows it to provide technical support and customized solutions for system solutions, enhancing the competitiveness of the system solution business. Overall, the company's power device business and system solution business are mutually beneficial and can create synergies, contributing to increased profitability, cost savings, and reduced operational risks."

The company's main products are injection molding equipment (also known as injection machines). Injection molding machines are mainly composed of injection and clamping units and can complete the processing processes of plasticizing, melt injection, mold filling, cooling, and ejection, making them the main processing tools for plastic products. Injection molding machines are electromechanical-hydraulic integrated products mainly composed of clamping mechanisms, injection units, hydraulic components, electrical components, frame components, and sheet metal components. Among them, the clamping mechanism, injection unit, and hydraulic components are the main components of injection molding machines. The clamping mechanism is one of the important components of injection molding machines. Its function is to realize the opening and closing movement of the mold, generate clamping force to lock the mold. Its main parameters include clamping force, tie-bar spacing, mold capacity, mold opening stroke, and ejector stroke. The clamping mechanism of a three-plate injection molding machine consists of a head plate, a moving plate, a tail plate, and a machine hinge, while the clamping mechanism of a two-plate injection molding machine consists of a head plate, a moving plate, and a direct pressure cylinder. The injection unit mainly functions to uniformly plasticize the plastic into a molten state and inject a certain amount of melt into the mold cavity with sufficient pressure and speed, realizing the plasticizing and metering of the processed plastic and the function of ejecting the melt. Its main parameters include screw diameter, injection volume, shot weight, injection pressure, injection rate, and plasticizing capacity. The injection unit is mainly composed of an injection head plate, an injection second plate, and a material tube assembly. The hydraulic components mainly provide power for various actions required by the process and meet the requirements of force, motion direction, and speed for various actions of the injection molding machine, realizing the conversion and transmission of the required energy during the molding process. The hydraulic components mainly consist of hydraulic elements such as oil pumps, cylinders, motors, hydraulic valves, and hydraulic auxiliary components such as oil tanks, oil pipes, and filters. The electrical components, also known as the control system, control various program actions of the injection molding machine and realize the setting and control of working procedures and process conditions through control and adjustment of time, position, pressure, speed, etc. The electrical components consist of special industrial computers, relay components, electronic components, detection components, and automatic instruments. The frame components provide basic support for various functional components and are the structural foundation for the stable operation of the injection molding machine. The injection molding machines produced by the company can be divided into two-plate injection molding machines and three-plate injection molding machines according to the structure of the clamping mechanism. The classification and main product series of injection molding machines are shown in the following table: 1. Mainly used for large-scale equipment with a clamping force of 500 tons or more, with two mold plates and a compact structure. 2. Large mold opening stroke, suitable for manufacturing large plastic products. Mainly used for small and medium-sized equipment with a clamping force of 1,000 tons or less, with three mold plates. (2) The company's main products. The clamping mechanism of the two-plate injection molding machine mainly consists of a moving mold plate, a fixed mold plate, and four sets of high-pressure clamping cylinders and tie rods. By directly driving the clamping action with hydraulic cylinders, the two-plate injection molding machine can achieve precise and flexible control of the clamping force to meet the requirements of complex injection molding processes. At the same time, the mold opening stroke of the two-plate injection molding machine can be flexibly adjusted to meet the needs of deep-cavity molds with ultra-long mold opening strokes. In addition, large two-plate injection molding machines can be designed with retractable tie bars to reduce the design height of the plant, save space, and reduce operating costs. The clamping tonnage of the two-plate injection molding machines produced by the company covers from 500 tons to 6,800 tons, the injection volume ranges from 1,539 cm³ to 280,000 cm³, the repeat position accuracy of mold opening and closing is up to 0.3mm, the repeat accuracy of injection volume is ≤0.3%, and the repeat accuracy of clamping force is ≤0.7%. The high-pressure clamping cylinder structure with independent patent technology can provide force in both directions. In the state of clamping, it provides clamping force in the forward direction and opening force in the reverse direction, with large and controllable opening force. The synchronous clamping mechanism with independent patent technology has fast clamping speed and low impact. The movement of the piston in the high-pressure clamping cylinder is individually controlled, and the clamping position can be adjusted to ensure accurate and fast clamping action. There are four tie rod guide sleeves on the moving mold plate, which are fixed on the fixed mold plate and tie rod support, providing guidance. The tie rod guide support is long and has good rigidity, ensuring smooth movement of the mold opening and closing. The high-pressure clamping cylinder is installed on the moving mold plate. During the loading of the clamping cylinder, the tie rods do not undergo relative movement, and the tie rods are evenly stressed, reducing the probability of tie rod breakage. The high-pressure clamping cylinder is rear-mounted, which can balance the weight of the mold, reduce the forward tilting of the moving mold plate caused by the weight of the mold, and increase the stability of mold opening and closing. The low-pressure quick mold opening and closing cylinder is used, and two-stage proportional pressure control is added to ensure low-pressure mold protection. It can achieve fast and accurate positioning and better protect the mold. The differential quick mold opening system can increase the mold opening speed by 30%.

Antigens and antibodies are the core raw materials of POCT reagents, and their performance affects the key performance indicators of POCT reagents, largely determining the upper limit of the performance of POCT reagents. The antigens and antibodies required for POCT reagents are usually divided into two categories: specific antigens/antibodies and universal antigens/antibodies. Specific antigens/antibodies are mainly used for specific binding reactions of antigens and antibodies to identify the presence of corresponding substances in the sample; universal antigens/antibodies mainly play a supporting role in testing, such as being used for quality control lines to improve product sensitivity and specificity. The company's self-developed antigens and antibodies can also be divided into these two categories, with universal antigens/antibodies already applied to the company's full range of reagent products, and specific antigens/antibodies partially applied to the company's drug testing, infectious disease testing, pregnancy testing, myocardial testing, tumor testing, and chronic disease testing series reagents, laying an important foundation for the continuous innovation, development, and stable production of the company's products. The company's self-supplied antigens and antibodies account for a certain proportion. The proportion of self-supplied universal antigens/antibodies has decreased, mainly due to the significant increase in the purchase of universal antigens/antibodies for COVID-19 test reagents. The company's self-supplied specific antigens/antibodies have decreased for various reasons, including cost reduction in external purchases, better performance of externally purchased materials, and product structure adjustments. The company has independently developed and produced seven POCT instruments since its establishment. These include dry fluorescence immunoassay analyzers, hemoglobin analyzers, blood glucose meters, blood lipid analyzers, and colloidal gold immunochromatographic analyzers. Five of these products have been sold domestically, and hemoglobin analyzers and blood lipid analyzers have been sold in the European Union. Two products, electronic pregnancy tests and handheld DOA readers, are currently undergoing domestic registration. The company has also developed COVID-19 test reagents. These reagents are used to detect the presence of the novel coronavirus in samples such as nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. They can be used with whole blood, serum, or plasma samples. The reagents detect the specific proteins of the novel coronavirus or the stress antibodies produced by the body after infection. The nucleic acid-specific gene detection of the novel coronavirus is considered the gold standard for diagnosis. The company's COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test kit is an antibody test kit that uses colloidal gold-labeled specific antigens of the novel coronavirus to bind with specific IgG or IgM antibodies in the specimen, forming a colloidal gold antigen-antibody complex. The complex is then captured by anti-human IgG and IgM antibodies on a nitrocellulose membrane, resulting in a visible red test line. The entire testing process takes only fifteen minutes. The company has obtained registrations for the COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test kit in countries such as the United States, Europe, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, Peru, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Italy, Ecuador, and Colombia, enabling overseas sales. In terms of domestic registration, the company has completed pre-evaluation by the Zhejiang Drug Evaluation Center and has submitted an application to the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). The limitation for domestic sales is the progress of product registration. The COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test kit is used to detect the presence of specific IgG or IgM antibodies to the novel coronavirus in blood samples. IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies are produced by the immune cells of the body in response to viral infection. IgM antibodies reflect whether the body is in an acute infection state and can be used as an auxiliary means of early diagnosis. IgM antibodies generally disappear within one month of infection. IgG antibodies play a protective role in the body's immune response and can be used to monitor the antibody status of patients in the recovery period. IgG antibodies persist in the body after infection with the novel coronavirus. IgM antibodies can be detected in the blood of patients 3-5 days after infection, while IgG antibodies can be detected 5-10 days after infection. The COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test kit developed by the company can determine the individual's infection status based on the appearance of lines on the test kit. The appearance of the IgM line indicates that the patient is in the early stage of viral infection, while the appearance of the IgG line indicates that the patient is in the recovery stage or has recovered from the infection. The company's COVID-19 test kit can be used to detect IgG and IgM antibodies in the body and screen symptomatic or asymptomatic virus-infected individuals.

(2) Main products or services. X-ray computed tomography equipment (CT). CT has the characteristics of fast scanning speed and high spatial resolution, and can provide important information for the examination, diagnosis, and treatment of various parts and organ lesions in medical institutions at all levels. The above-mentioned CT includes mobile and cabin versions. Positron emission and X-ray computed tomography equipment (PET/CT). It combines the molecular metabolic activity images obtained from PET scans with the dynamic and functional information obtained from CT scans to perform functional and anatomical imaging of the whole body tissues, mainly used in the fields of tumors, cardiovascular, and nervous systems. Note: The ScintCare PET/CT medical device registration certificate expired in October 2021, and the issuer has not renewed it. 1. X-ray computed tomography imaging system (CT). X-ray computed tomography imaging system (Computed Tomography, CT) emits X-rays through the X-ray tube, which penetrate the human body and are received and converted into digital signals by the detector. After computer transformation and processing, they form sectional or three-dimensional images of the examined area, thereby detecting lesions in human tissues or organs. CT has the characteristics of high density resolution, fast scanning time, and clear images, and is one of the most effective clinical large-scale medical imaging diagnostic equipment. CT is mainly composed of hardware such as the X-ray tube, high voltage, detector, slip ring, and gantry, as well as software systems such as data acquisition system, image processing software, gantry control system, human-computer interaction system, and console software system. The various software and hardware are interconnected through system integration and controlled and coordinated by the computer system to complete functions such as X-ray generation, X-ray signal acquisition and storage, data processing, image reconstruction, display, and storage. The X-ray tube is the component that generates X-rays by converting electrical energy. The high voltage generator is a device that provides the high voltage function for filament heating and electron acceleration of X-ray equipment. The collimator is used to adjust the size of the X-ray field emitted by the X-ray tube. The detector is the core component of CT, which receives the X-rays attenuated after passing through the human body, converts them into visible light, and then converts them into electrical signals through photoelectric conversion. After that, they are converted into digital signals through an analog/digital converter and output as images, playing a decisive role in the imaging quality. The more slices the detector has and the wider the coverage, the shorter the time required for scanning the same range, and the higher the time resolution of the scanned object, especially for coronary artery scanning. Currently, the widest coverage can reach 160mm. While CT is rotating at high speed, it transfers high-power current, communication signals, and high-speed image digital signals through the slip ring. The gantry contains devices such as the X-ray tube, high voltage generator, and detector. During the diagnosis process, the gantry rotates around the patient being examined. The higher the rotation speed of the gantry, the faster the scanning speed of the equipment, the higher the original time resolution of CT, and the higher the success rate of coronary artery examination. Currently, the fastest scanning speed in the world can reach 0.25 seconds per rotation. The detector captures the X-ray signals transmitted through the human body and transfers them to the acquisition workstation for storage through the signal transmission link. The data is then reconstructed and post-processed to form human images that can be viewed by doctors. The image reconstruction algorithm determines key indicators such as the resolution and uniformity of human images and also affects the utilization of dose. The human-computer interaction system controls the bed, laser lights, etc., to position the patient. The gantry control system controls the X-ray tube and high voltage generator to turn on and off the X-rays. The operator selects the acquisition protocol and preset loading parameters through the console software system. The company's CT product line mainly includes 8-slice, 16-slice, 24-slice, 48-slice, 64-slice, 256-slice, mobile CT series, and Ark CT series, covering a wide range of clinical practical models, ultra-high-end research models, and mobile medical equipment, meeting the diversified needs of disease screening, clinical diagnosis, and research. It is suitable for routine scanning in primary medical institutions and provides X-ray tomography scan information for physical examinations, diagnosis, and treatment. It can perform examinations of various parts including the heart and provide X-ray tomography scans. It is suitable for clinical and research purposes in hospitals. It can quickly and low-radiation dose complete examinations of various parts including the heart, providing morphological and functional information. It can cover the entire organs such as the head, heart, and liver without moving the bed; it can achieve spectral scanning. To solve the problems of inconvenient isolation, insufficient CT equipment, and lack of machine rooms during the COVID-19 epidemic, the company developed the Ark CT, which does not require the construction and decoration of machine rooms and can be used by simply installing and powering it outdoors, facilitating the diversion and isolation of infected patients. The product adopts a class-negative pressure, dual-channel design for medical staff and patients, and separate operation rooms to avoid cross-infection and protect the safety of medical staff. It is used in mobile scenarios, with a dual-channel design for medical staff and patients, avoiding cross-infection between medical staff and patients. It is suitable for routine physical examinations, disaster relief, medical support for large-scale events, emergency and pre-hospital diagnosis, etc., and can be moved to rural areas, nursing homes, disaster areas, and other regions. The company has the research and production capabilities of the core component detector of CT. Based on the key technology development of the Ministry of Science and Technology's ""Twelfth Five-Year Plan"" project ""Industrialization of CT Detector and Core Components,"" the company independently developed and designed the ScintiStar CT detector; based on the key technology research and development and industrialization of the Ministry of Science and Technology's ""Thirteenth Five-Year Plan"" national key research and development project ""Modular CT Detector and Core Component,"" the company independently developed and designed the DivineLight CT detector with better performance, and achieved the application of the first 160mm spherical wide-body detector in China on the ultra-high-end research 256-slice CT. 2. Positron emission and X-ray computed tomography imaging system (PET/CT). Positron emission and X-ray computed tomography imaging system (Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography, PET/CT) is a high-end medical device for functional and anatomical imaging of the human body and its organs. It is suitable for whole-body or local tumor examination, cardiovascular system examination, and brain and nervous system examination. PET/CT combines PET and CT to achieve diagnostic functions. PET can reflect the metabolism of positron tracer drugs in human cells, observe early functional changes in cells or tissues at the molecular level, and has the characteristics of high sensitivity, strong specificity, and good quantification, which is suitable for early detection of lesions. CT can provide high-precision anatomical structure information for clinical diagnosis. PET/CT consists of a CT host and a PET host. The PET host consists of a detector system, front-end electronics, back-end electronics, and reconstruction system, which realize the acquisition and imaging of gamma rays. The company is one of the few companies in China that has been engaged in the research and development of PET/CT products and obtained medical device registration certificates. By undertaking the Ministry of Science and Technology's ""Twelfth Five-Year Plan"" project ""Research and Development of PET/CT Core Technology and Key Components and System Integration,"" the company was the first in the industry to use SiPM (Silicon Photomultiplier) to replace the previous generation of traditional PMT (Photomultiplier Tube), and applied SiPM digital technology and BGO/LYSO crystals in a 1:1 coupling manner to PET/CT products, achieving significant improvements in performance in terms of time resolution, energy resolution, and spatial resolution. The company's first PET/CT product was eventually approved for special approval of innovative medical devices by the National Medical Products Administration and was selected as a ""domestic first"" product in the Catalog of Innovative Medical Devices (2018) by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China. It adopts the fourth-generation MF digital detector, and the LYSO crystal is coupled with SiPM in a 1:1 full coverage design, with a TOF time resolution of 480ps.

It is an ultra-high-end fully digital PET/CT system, using the fourth-generation MF digital detector, greatly improving the system's detection capability. It achieves an industry-leading axial field of view of 403.2mm and comprehensive performance (ultra-high system sensitivity, 5kcps/MBq, TOF time resolution of 380ps, etc.), providing accurate clinical diagnosis and research-preferred models. 3. Other medical imaging products. In recent years, the company has also been developing other medical imaging products. It has obtained medical device registration certificates for two superconducting magnetic resonance imaging systems (MRI), four digital medical X-ray imaging equipment (DR), and two ultrasound diagnostic equipment (US). However, due to production capacity and funding constraints, it has not yet formed large-scale sales. MRI utilizes the resonance phenomenon of atomic nuclei (mainly hydrogen protons) in the human body when placed in a strong magnetic field to image, with higher soft tissue resolution, especially suitable for soft tissue and nervous system imaging, without ionizing radiation, complementing CT equipment. X-ray equipment uses the principle that X-rays attenuate differently when passing through different tissues and organs of the human body. It projects X-rays that have passed through the patient's body and carry sufficient information onto the imaging medium, forming visible grayscale images. It is suitable for X-ray imaging examinations of the chest, abdomen, and limbs. Ultrasound equipment uses the echo signals of ultrasound waves to generate various types of images by transmitting ultrasonic pulses into the human body and recording and analyzing the reflected echoes. It is suitable for comprehensive scanning of superficial, abdominal, cardiac, obstetric and gynecological, urological, musculoskeletal, and other parts."	Medical equipment	1.
